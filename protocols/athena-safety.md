## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Pregnancy | Unknown fetal effects; potentially harmful |
| Breastfeeding | Peptides may pass into breast milk |
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH/growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Trying to Conceive | Effects on fertility/conception unknown; Rapamycin affects ovulation |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism; Rapamycin contraindicated |
| Oestrogen-Sensitive Cancers History | Breast, ovarian, endometrial cancer history |
| Age <18 | Not studied in paediatrics |
| Uncontrolled Hypertension | PT-141 can transiently increase BP |
| Paget's Disease of Bone | Teriparatide contraindicated (if using optional addon) |
| Prior Skeletal Radiation | Teriparatide contraindicated (if using optional addon) |

---

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with caution:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| PCOS | May benefit from protocol (Myo-Inositol helpful) but monitor hormones closely |
| Endometriosis | Growth factors may affect; discuss with gynaecologist |
| Fibroids | Monitor for changes; growth factors caution |
| Thyroid Disorders | Women at higher risk; monitor closely; Rapamycin may affect thyroid |
| Autoimmune Conditions | More common in women; immune peptides need monitoring |
| Eating Disorders History | Body composition focus may be triggering |
| Diabetes | GH affects glucose; Metformin beneficial but monitor |
| Perimenopause/Menopause | May be beneficial but adjust expectations |
| On HRT/Birth Control | Inform physician; may affect hormone interpretation; DIM affects oestrogen metabolism |
| Cardiac Valve Disease | Cabergoline caution (high doses associated with valvulopathy; low protocol doses likely safe) |
| Hyperprolactinaemia from Pituitary Tumour | Requires specialist management if using Cabergoline |
| Immunocompromised | Rapamycin further suppresses immunity |
| Migraine with Aura | PT-141 may trigger; use with caution |

## Potential Side Effects — Female-Specific

| Category | Effects | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Menstrual Changes** | Cycle irregularity, spotting, flow changes | Track cycle; if persistent >2 cycles, evaluate |
| **Hormonal** | Mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating | Often transient; adjust timing around cycle |
| **Injection Site** | Redness, bruising, pain | Rotate sites; avoid stretch mark areas |
| **GH-Related** | Water retention, joint discomfort | Reduce Tesamorelin dose; women more sensitive |
| **Skin** | Oiliness, breakouts (usually temporary) | Usually resolves; adjust GHK-Cu if needed |
| **Sleep** | Vivid dreams, sleep changes (DSIP) | Adjust DSIP dose; often a positive effect |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, breathing difficulty | **STOP immediately**; emergency if severe |

## Compound-Specific Considerations

### PT-141 (Bremelanotide)
- **FDA-approved for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder**
- Common: Flushing (40%), nausea (25%), headache
- **Transient BP increase** — avoid in uncontrolled hypertension
- Maximum 2x/week dosing; effects last 24-72 hours
- Nausea usually resolves with repeated use

### Kisspeptin-10
- Affects GnRH axis — may shift ovulation timing
- Useful for hormonal balance but **use with caution if timing conception**
- Pulsed dosing recommended around cycle

### Semax
- Crosses blood-brain barrier; cognitive enhancer
- Generally well-tolerated
- Rare: irritability, overstimulation — reduce dose if occurs
- May enhance mood or cause mild anxiety in sensitive individuals

### DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)
- Vivid dreams common — usually pleasant/neutral
- Rarely: next-day grogginess — adjust timing or reduce dose
- May enhance sleep architecture and recovery

### Cabergoline
- **Dopamine agonist** — affects mood, motivation, libido
- Low protocol doses (0.25-0.5mg 1-2x/week) much safer than Parkinson's doses
- High cumulative doses associated with cardiac valve fibrosis — monitor with echo if long-term use
- Side effects: nausea, dizziness, headache (usually transient)
- **Do not combine with dopamine antagonists** (antipsychotics, metoclopramide)

### Rapamycin
- **VIBRANT trial**: 20% slower ovarian aging
- **Mouth sores common** (10-20%) — usually mild
- May affect menstrual cycle regularity
- **Immunosuppressive** — monitor for infections
- **Delays wound healing** — hold before surgery
- Interacts with CYP3A4 inhibitors (grapefruit, azole antifungals)

### DIM (Diindolylmethane)
- Shifts oestrogen metabolism toward "protective" metabolites
- **May lower oestrogen more than expected** — monitor if on HRT
- Generally very safe; rare GI upset

### Myo-Inositol
- Excellent safety profile
- Beneficial for PCOS, insulin sensitivity, egg quality
- High doses may cause mild GI upset

### Boron
- Generally very safe at protocol doses (6-10mg)
- Excessive doses (>20mg) may affect hormones
- Take with Vitamin D3 for synergy

### Teriparatide (Optional — Severe Osteoporosis Only)
- **BLACK BOX WARNING**: Osteosarcoma risk in rat studies
- **Maximum 2 years lifetime use**
- Reserved for T-score ≤-2.5 or fragility fracture
- Requires transition to bisphosphonate/denosumab after course
- Contraindicated: Paget's disease, prior skeletal radiation, skeletal malignancy
- Monitor serum calcium

### BPC-157
- May affect coagulation — caution with bleeding disorders
- Generally well-tolerated; supports gut-hormone axis

## Menstrual Cycle Considerations

| Phase | Days | Adjustments |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Follicular** | 1-14 | Full protocol; GH well tolerated; Iron if heavy flow |
| **Ovulation** | ~14 | Full protocol; peak energy — good for intensive peptides; Kisspeptin timing important |
| **Luteal** | 15-28 | May reduce MOTS-c if bloating; increase Mg, Selank for mood support |
| **Perimenstrual** | 26-2 | Prioritise Selank for mood; Glycine+DSIP for sleep; Progesterone if prescribed |

---

## Menopausal Status Considerations

| Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Pre-menopausal** | Track cycle; adjust peptides around phases; Kisspeptin for cycle support |
| **Perimenopausal** | Hormone fluctuations expected; may see enhanced benefits; bone density focus |
| **Post-menopausal** | Protocol particularly beneficial; NAD+ for ovarian restoration; bone density critical; HRT synergistic |

---

## Drug Interactions

| Medication | Interaction Concern | Recommendation |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Dopamine Antagonists** | Reduce Cabergoline efficacy | Metoclopramide, antipsychotics — avoid combination |
| Other Dopamine Agonists | Additive dopaminergic effects | Pramipexole, ropinirole — use caution |
| Antihypertensives | PT-141 may transiently raise BP | Monitor BP; may need adjustment |
| **CYP3A4 Inhibitors** | Increase Rapamycin levels | Grapefruit, ketoconazole, erythromycin — avoid or adjust |
| Immunosuppressants | Additive with Rapamycin | Careful monitoring required |
| SSRIs/SNRIs | May interact with cognitive peptides | Monitor mood; usually safe |
| Thyroid Medications | Rapamycin may affect thyroid | Monitor thyroid function |
| Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation | Monitor if on blood thinners |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Lactic acidosis risk | Hold Metformin 48h before/after |

---

## HRT/Birth Control Interactions

| Medication | Consideration |
|------------|---------------|
| Oestrogen HRT | Monitor oestrogen levels; DIM supports metabolism; may enhance protocol benefits |
| Progesterone HRT | May enhance sleep benefits; adjust DSIP accordingly |
| Combined Pill | Inform provider; affects baseline hormone interpretation |
| Progestogen-only | Fewer interactions; monitor as usual |
| IUD (hormonal) | Local effects; minimal systemic interaction |
| Testosterone (low-dose) | Protocol includes; monitor total and free T |

---

## Pre-Procedure Considerations

| Procedure | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Surgery | Stop Rapamycin 1-2 weeks before |
| IVF/Fertility Treatment | Discuss all peptides with reproductive endocrinologist |
| IV Contrast imaging | Hold Metformin 48h before and after |
| Mammography | No specific interactions; continue protocol |

---

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe pelvic pain
- Heavy unexpected bleeding
- Severe mood changes or confusion
- Signs of serious infection (high fever) — especially on Rapamycin
- Severe nausea/vomiting after PT-141 (rare but possible)
