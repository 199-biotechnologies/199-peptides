# Athena Protocol — Safety Considerations

---

## Absolute Contraindications

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Pregnancy / Breastfeeding | Unknown fetal effects; peptides may pass to milk |
| Trying to Conceive | Effects unknown; Rapamycin affects ovulation |
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH/growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Oestrogen-Sensitive Cancer History | Breast, ovarian, endometrial |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism; Rapamycin contraindicated |
| Uncontrolled Hypertension | PT-141 transiently increases BP |
| Paget's Disease / Prior Skeletal Radiation | Teriparatide contraindicated |

---

## Relative Contraindications

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Endometriosis / Fibroids | Growth factors may affect; monitor |
| Thyroid Disorders | Higher risk in women; Rapamycin may affect |
| Cardiac Valve Disease | Cabergoline: high doses linked to valvulopathy |
| Pituitary Prolactinoma | Specialist management if using Cabergoline |
| Immunocompromised | Rapamycin further suppresses immunity |
| Migraine with Aura | PT-141 may trigger |
| On HRT | DIM affects oestrogen metabolism; monitor levels |

## Critical Compound Warnings

### PT-141 (Bremelanotide)
- **Transient BP increase** — avoid in uncontrolled hypertension
- Flushing (40%), nausea (25%) common
- Max 2x/week

### Cabergoline
- **Do not combine with dopamine antagonists** (antipsychotics, metoclopramide)
- Cardiac echo if prolonged use (valvulopathy risk at high cumulative doses)

### Rapamycin
- **Immunosuppressive** — monitor for infections
- **Mouth sores** (10-20%)
- **Delays wound healing** — hold 1-2 weeks before surgery
- **CYP3A4 interactions** — avoid grapefruit, azole antifungals

### Kisspeptin-10
- May shift ovulation timing — caution if timing conception

### Teriparatide (Optional)
- **BLACK BOX**: Osteosarcoma risk in rat studies
- **Max 2 years lifetime use**
- Monitor serum calcium
- Contraindicated: Paget's, skeletal radiation, skeletal malignancy

### BPC-157
- May affect coagulation — caution with anticoagulants

### DIM
- May lower oestrogen more than expected — monitor if on HRT

## Drug Interactions

| Medication | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| **Dopamine Antagonists** | Reduce Cabergoline efficacy — avoid combination |
| **CYP3A4 Inhibitors** | Increase Rapamycin levels — grapefruit, ketoconazole, erythromycin |
| Antihypertensives | PT-141 transiently raises BP |
| Immunosuppressants | Additive with Rapamycin |
| Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h before/after |

---

## Pre-Procedure

| Procedure | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Surgery | Stop Rapamycin 1-2 weeks before |
| IVF/Fertility Treatment | Discuss all peptides with reproductive endocrinologist |
| IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h |

## Emergency Signs

Seek emergency care if:
- Anaphylaxis
- Chest pain / shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot
- Severe pelvic pain
- Heavy unexpected bleeding
- Signs of serious infection (especially on Rapamycin)
- Severe nausea/vomiting after PT-141
