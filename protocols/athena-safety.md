## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Pregnancy | Unknown fetal effects; potentially harmful |
| Breastfeeding | Peptides may pass into breast milk |
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH/growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Trying to Conceive | Effects on fertility/conception unknown |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism |
| Oestrogen-Sensitive Cancers History | Breast, ovarian, endometrial cancer history |
| Age <18 | Not studied in paediatrics |

---

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with caution:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| PCOS | May benefit from protocol but monitor hormones closely |
| Endometriosis | Growth factors may affect; discuss with gynaecologist |
| Fibroids | Monitor for changes; growth factors caution |
| Thyroid Disorders | Women at higher risk; monitor closely |
| Autoimmune Conditions | More common in women; immune peptides need monitoring |
| Eating Disorders History | Body composition focus may be triggering |
| Diabetes | GH affects glucose; monitor closely |
| Perimenopause/Menopause | May be beneficial but adjust expectations |
| On HRT/Birth Control | Inform physician; may affect hormone interpretation |

## Potential Side Effects — Female-Specific

| Category | Effects | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Menstrual Changes** | Cycle irregularity, spotting, flow changes | Track cycle; if persistent, evaluate |
| **Hormonal** | Mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating | Often transient; adjust timing around cycle |
| **Injection Site** | Redness, bruising, pain | Rotate sites; avoid stretch mark areas |
| **GH-Related** | Water retention, joint discomfort | Reduce dose; women more sensitive |
| **Skin** | Oiliness, breakouts (usually temporary) | Usually resolves; adjust GHK-Cu if needed |
| **Sleep** | Vivid dreams, sleep changes | Adjust DSIP dose; may be positive effect |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, breathing difficulty | **STOP immediately**; emergency if severe |

---

## Menstrual Cycle Considerations

| Phase | Days | Adjustments |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Follicular** | 1-14 | Full protocol; GH well tolerated; Iron if heavy flow |
| **Ovulation** | ~14 | Full protocol; peak energy — good for intensive peptides |
| **Luteal** | 15-28 | May reduce MOTS-c if bloating; increase Mg, L-Theanine |
| **Perimenstrual** | 26-2 | Prioritise Selank for mood; Glycine+DSIP for sleep |

---

## Menopausal Status Considerations

| Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Pre-menopausal** | Track cycle; adjust peptides around phases |
| **Perimenopausal** | Hormone fluctuations expected; may see enhanced benefits |
| **Post-menopausal** | Protocol particularly beneficial; bone density focus important |

---

## HRT/Birth Control Interactions

| Medication | Consideration |
|------------|---------------|
| Oestrogen HRT | Monitor oestrogen levels; DIM supports metabolism |
| Progesterone HRT | May enhance sleep benefits; adjust DSIP accordingly |
| Combined Pill | Inform provider; affects baseline hormone interpretation |
| Progestogen-only | Fewer interactions; monitor as usual |
| IUD (hormonal) | Local effects; minimal systemic interaction |

---

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe pelvic pain
- Heavy unexpected bleeding
- Severe mood changes or confusion
