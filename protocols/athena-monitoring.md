# Athena Protocol — Assessment & Monitoring

**Related:** [Athena Protocol](athena-protocol.md) | [Safety Considerations](athena-safety.md)

---

## Mandatory Safety Bloodwork — Female Panel

Complete at **BASELINE**, **WEEK 8**, and **WEEK 16**. Test during **follicular phase (days 3-7)** for consistency.

---

## Core Safety Panel (Mandatory)

| Test | Monitors | Red Flags |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CBC with Differential | Blood cells, haemoglobin | Anaemia common in menstruating women |
| CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic) | Electrolytes, glucose, liver, kidney | Organ dysfunction |
| Fasting Glucose + Insulin | Blood sugar, insulin resistance | PCOS/metabolic concerns |
| HbA1c | 3-month glucose average | >5.7% prediabetic |
| Liver (ALT, AST, GGT) | Liver health | >2x upper limit = concern |
| Kidney (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) | Kidney function | eGFR <60 = caution |
| Lipid Panel | CV risk | Significant changes |
| IGF-1 | GH axis response | Supraphysiologic = reduce GH dose |
| TSH, Free T3, Free T4, TPO Ab | Thyroid (women high risk) | Autoimmune thyroid common |

---

## Female Hormone Panel (Critical)

| Test | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Oestradiol (E2) | Primary oestrogen | Test day 3 of cycle for baseline |
| Progesterone | Ovulation confirmation | Test day 21 (luteal phase) |
| FSH, LH | Pituitary/ovarian function | Test day 3; FSH:LH ratio meaningful |
| Total/Free Testosterone | Androgen status | Elevated in PCOS |
| SHBG | Hormone binding | Low in insulin resistance |
| DHEA-S | Adrenal androgens | Stress, energy assessment |
| AMH (if fertility relevant) | Ovarian reserve | Does not change with cycle |
| Prolactin | Pituitary function | Elevated can affect cycle |
| Cortisol (AM) | Adrenal function | Stress assessment |

---

## Female-Specific Additional Tests

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Iron, Ferritin, TIBC | Iron status — critical for menstruating women |
| Vitamin D (25-OH) | Bone health, mood, immune — women often deficient |
| Vitamin B12, Folate | Energy, if on birth control or vegetarian |
| Calcium, PTH | Bone health assessment |
| hsCRP, Homocysteine | Inflammation, CV risk |

---

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Biological Age (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation age assessment |
| GlycanAge | Alternative biological age marker |
| Telomere Length | Pre/post Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Comprehensive hormone metabolites — excellent for women |
| Organic Acids Test | Mitochondrial function |
| DEXA Scan | Bone density — especially peri/post-menopause |

---

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core + Hormone Panel + Female-Specific | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |
| **WEEK 4** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1 | Early safety check if concerns |
| **WEEK 8** | Core + Hormone Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1 | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core + Hormone + Advanced Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

## Cycle Phase Testing Guide

| Test | When to Test | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Oestradiol, FSH, LH | Day 3-5 (early follicular) | Baseline ovarian function |
| Progesterone | Day 21 (mid-luteal) | Confirms ovulation |
| AMH | Any day | Cycle-independent |
| All other tests | Day 3-7 (follicular) | Hormonal stability |

---

## Key Markers by Goal

### Hormonal Balance
- Oestradiol, Progesterone, FSH, LH, Testosterone, SHBG, Prolactin

### Bone Density
- Vitamin D, Calcium, PTH, DEXA scan, Oestradiol

### Skin & Collagen
- IGF-1, Vitamin C status, Iron/Ferritin

### Ovarian Health (Fertility-Relevant)
- AMH, FSH, LH, Oestradiol, Progesterone

### Thyroid (High Priority for Women)
- TSH, Free T3, Free T4, TPO Antibodies, Reverse T3

---

## Iron Status — Critical for Women

| Marker | Optimal | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Ferritin | 50-100 ng/mL | <30 = supplement; <15 = investigate |
| Haemoglobin | 12-15 g/dL | <12 = anaemia workup |
| Iron | Mid-range | Context with ferritin/TIBC |
| TIBC | Normal range | Elevated = iron deficiency |
