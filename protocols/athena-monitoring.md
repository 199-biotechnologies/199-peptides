| Ovulation | Monitor if timing conception |

### NAD+ — Ovarian Restoration
| Monitoring | Notes |
|------------|-------|

| Energy levels | Subjective improvement expected |

### Teriparatide (Optional — Severe Osteoporosis)
| Monitoring | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Serum calcium | Normal range | Can elevate calcium |
| DEXA scan | T-score improvement | Monitor bone density |
| Duration | Max 2 years lifetime | Black box warning; osteosarcoma risk in rats |

---

## Female-Specific Additional Tests

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Iron, Ferritin, TIBC | Iron status — **critical for menstruating women** |
| Vitamin D (25-OH) | Bone health, mood, immune — women often deficient |
| Vitamin B12, Folate | Energy, if on birth control or vegetarian |
| Calcium, PTH | Bone health assessment |
| hsCRP, Homocysteine | Inflammation, CV risk |

---

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Biological Age (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation age assessment |
| GlycanAge | Alternative biological age marker |
| Telomere Length | Pre/post Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Comprehensive hormone metabolites — **excellent for women** |
| Organic Acids Test | Mitochondrial function |
| DEXA Scan | Bone density — **especially peri/post-menopause** |

---

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core + Hormone Panel + Female-Specific | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |
| **WEEK 4** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Prolactin | Early safety check |
| **WEEK 8** | Core + Hormone Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Prolactin | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core + Hormone + Advanced Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

## Cycle Phase Testing Guide

| Test | When to Test | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Oestradiol, FSH, LH | Day 3-5 (early follicular) | Baseline ovarian function |
| Progesterone | Day 21 (mid-luteal) | Confirms ovulation |
| AMH | Any day | Cycle-independent |
| Prolactin | Day 3-7 (follicular) | Consistent baseline |
| All other tests | Day 3-7 (follicular) | Hormonal stability |

## Key Markers by Goal

### Hormonal Balance
- Oestradiol, Progesterone, FSH, LH, Testosterone, SHBG, Prolactin
- DUTCH test for detailed metabolite analysis

### Bone Density
- Vitamin D, Calcium, PTH, DEXA scan, Oestradiol
- T-score monitoring (especially perimenopause+)

### Skin & Collagen
- IGF-1, Vitamin C status, Iron/Ferritin
- Subjective assessment (photos)

### Ovarian Health (Fertility-Relevant)
- AMH, FSH, LH, Oestradiol, Progesterone
- Monitor for Rapamycin effects on ovarian aging

### Sexual Function (PT-141 Response)
- Subjective assessment, blood pressure monitoring
- Track nausea/flushing side effects

### Thyroid (High Priority for Women)
- TSH, Free T3, Free T4, TPO Antibodies, Reverse T3
- Women at higher autoimmune thyroid risk

### Mood & Stress
- Cortisol (AM), DHEA-S
- Subjective assessment of Selank/Semax effects

## Iron Status — Critical for Women

| Marker | Optimal | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Ferritin | 50-100 ng/mL | <30 = supplement; <15 = investigate |
| Haemoglobin | 12-15 g/dL | <12 = anaemia workup |
| Iron | Mid-range | Context with ferritin/TIBC |
| TIBC | Normal range | Elevated = iron deficiency |

---

## IGF-1 Targets (Tesamorelin)

| Status | IGF-1 Range | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Optimal | 150-250 ng/mL | Continue current dosing |
| Elevated | >300 ng/mL | Reduce Tesamorelin dose |
| Supraphysiologic | >400 ng/mL | Stop Tesamorelin; retest in 4 weeks |

*Note: Women may be more sensitive to GH effects; start conservatively.*

---

## Menopausal Status Considerations

| Status | Monitoring Notes |
|--------|------------------|
| **Pre-menopausal** | Track cycle; test in follicular phase; AMH relevant |
| **Perimenopausal** | Expect hormone fluctuations; FSH may be elevated; symptoms variable |
| **Post-menopausal** | FSH/LH elevated; oestradiol low baseline; HRT interpretation differs |

---

## Pre-Procedure Checklist

| Compound | Action Before Procedure |
|----------|------------------------|
| Rapamycin | Hold 1-2 weeks before surgery |
| Metformin | Hold 48h before/after IV contrast |
| PT-141 | Inform anaesthesiologist (BP effects) |
