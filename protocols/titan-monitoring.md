## Mandatory Safety Bloodwork — Male Panel

Complete at **BASELINE**, **WEEK 8**, and **WEEK 16**.

---

## Core Safety Panel (Mandatory)

| Test | Monitors | Red Flags |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CBC with Differential | Blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit | High haematocrit (>52%) = concern with GH |
| CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic) | Electrolytes, glucose, liver, kidney | Organ dysfunction |
| Fasting Glucose + Insulin | Blood sugar, insulin resistance | >100 fasting or high insulin |
| HbA1c | 3-month glucose average | >5.7% prediabetic |
| Liver (ALT, AST, GGT) | Liver health | >2x upper limit = concern |
| Kidney (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) | Kidney function | eGFR <60 = caution |
| Lipid Panel | CV risk | Significant changes |
| IGF-1 | GH axis response | Supraphysiologic = reduce GH dose |
| TSH, Free T3, Free T4 | Thyroid function | Abnormal = investigate |

---

## Male Hormone Panel (Critical)

| Test | Purpose | Optimal |
|------|---------|---------|
| Total Testosterone | Overall T status | 500-900 ng/dL (age-adjusted) |
| Free Testosterone | Bioavailable T | Upper quartile for age |
| SHBG | Binding protein | Helps interpret free T |
| Oestradiol (sensitive) | Oestrogen balance | 20-35 pg/mL typically |
| LH, FSH | Pituitary function | Assesses HPTA |
| DHT | Potent androgen | If hair loss or prostate concerns |
| DHEA-S | Adrenal androgen | Age-appropriate |
| PSA (Men >40) | Prostate health | <4.0; track changes from baseline |

---

## Extended Panel (Recommended)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| hsCRP | Inflammation marker |
| Homocysteine | Cardiovascular/methylation |
| Vitamin D (25-OH) | Immune, bone, testosterone support |
| Ferritin | Iron stores |
| ApoB | Atherogenic particle count |
| Lp(a) | Genetic cardiovascular risk |
| Oxidised LDL | Advanced CV risk |

---

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Biological Age (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation age |
| Telomere Length | Pre/post Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Hormone metabolites |
| Organic Acids Test | Mitochondrial function |
| GDF-15 | Aging/mitochondrial stress marker |

---

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core + Male Hormone Panel + Extended | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |
| **WEEK 4** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Haematocrit | Early safety check |
| **WEEK 8** | Core + Male Hormone Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Haematocrit | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core + Hormone + Advanced Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

## Key Markers by Goal

### Testosterone Optimisation
- Total T, Free T, SHBG, Oestradiol, LH, FSH, DHT

### Muscle & Performance
- IGF-1, Testosterone, Creatine Kinase, Haematocrit

### Cardiovascular Health
- ApoB, LDL, Lp(a), hsCRP, Haematocrit, BP

### Cognitive Enhancement
- IGF-1, Thyroid panel, Homocysteine, Vitamin D

### Prostate Monitoring (Men >40)
- PSA (track changes), Free PSA ratio if elevated

---

## Haematocrit Monitoring — Critical for Men

| Level | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| <50% | Normal | Continue protocol |
| 50-52% | Elevated | Monitor closely; hydrate; consider dose reduction |
| >52% | High | Reduce GH peptides; consider phlebotomy; consult |
| >54% | Critical | Stop protocol; urgent medical review |

---

## PSA Tracking

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PSA <4.0, stable | Continue protocol |
| PSA increase >0.75/year | Investigate; urology referral |
| PSA >4.0 | Urology evaluation before continuing |
| Any prostate symptoms | Evaluate promptly |

---

## IGF-1 Targets

| Status | IGF-1 Range | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Optimal | 150-250 ng/mL | Continue current dosing |
| Elevated | >300 ng/mL | Reduce GH peptide dose |
| Supraphysiologic | >400 ng/mL | Stop GH peptides; retest in 4 weeks |
