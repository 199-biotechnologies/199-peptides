| HbA1c | 3-month glucose average | >5.7% prediabetic |
| Liver (ALT, AST, GGT) | Liver health | >2x upper limit = concern |
| Kidney (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) | Kidney function | eGFR <60 = caution |
| Lipid Panel | CV risk | Significant changes |
| IGF-1 | GH axis response (Tesamorelin) | Supraphysiologic = reduce dose |
| TSH, Free T3, Free T4 | Thyroid function | Abnormal = investigate |

## Male Hormone Panel (Critical)

| Test | Purpose | Optimal |
|------|---------|---------|
| Total Testosterone | Overall T status | 500-900 ng/dL (age-adjusted) |
| Free Testosterone | Bioavailable T | Upper quartile for age |
| SHBG | Binding protein | Helps interpret free T |
| Oestradiol (sensitive) | Oestrogen balance | 20-35 pg/mL typically |
| LH, FSH | Pituitary function | Assesses HPTA (suppressed on TRT) |
| DHT | Potent androgen | If hair loss or prostate concerns |

### Tesamorelin — GH Effects
| Marker | Target | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| IGF-1 | 150-250 ng/mL | >300 = reduce dose; >400 = stop |

| Duration | 10-14 days only; 2 courses per protocol |

### Dihexa — Experimental Cognitive
| Monitoring | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Mood/cognition | Track subjective changes |
| Sleep quality | May affect |
| Cycle | 4-6 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off |
| Start dose | Begin at 10mg; assess before increasing |

### TB-500 — Angiogenic Caution
| Monitoring | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Cancer screening | **Contraindicated with any cancer history** |
| Healing response | Expected benefit for injuries |
| Loading/maintenance | 2x/week loading → 1x/week maintenance |

### Tirzepatide — GLP-1/GIP
| Monitoring | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Weight/body composition | Expected changes |
| GI symptoms | Nausea common initially |
| Appetite | Significant reduction expected |

---

## Extended Panel (Recommended)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| hsCRP | Inflammation marker |
| Homocysteine | Cardiovascular/methylation (monitor with Metformin/TMG) |
| Vitamin D (25-OH) | Immune, bone, testosterone support |
| Ferritin | Iron stores |
| ApoB | Atherogenic particle count |
| Lp(a) | Genetic cardiovascular risk (one-time) |
| Oxidised LDL | Advanced CV risk |

---

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Biological Age (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation age |
| Telomere Length | Pre/post Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Hormone metabolites |
| Organic Acids Test | Mitochondrial function |
| GDF-15 | Aging/mitochondrial stress marker |

---

## Cognitive Function Assessment (Dihexa/Semax)

| Assessment | Frequency | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Subjective cognition | Weekly | Memory, focus, processing speed |
| Mood tracking | Weekly | Dihexa/Semax affect mood |
| Sleep quality | Daily | Both compounds may affect sleep |
| Formal cognitive testing | Baseline + Week 16 | Optional; establishes objective baseline |

---

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core + Male Hormone Panel + Extended | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |
| **WEEK 4** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Haematocrit | Early safety check |
| **WEEK 8** | Core + Male Hormone Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1, Haematocrit | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core + Hormone + Advanced Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

## Haematocrit Monitoring — Critical for Men

| Level | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| <50% | Normal | Continue protocol |
| 50-52% | Elevated | Monitor closely; hydrate; consider dose reduction |
| >52% | High | Reduce GH peptides and/or TRT; consider phlebotomy; consult |
| >54% | Critical | **Stop protocol; urgent medical review** |

*Note: GH + Testosterone can elevate haematocrit significantly. Monitor at every blood draw.*

---

## PSA Tracking

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PSA <4.0, stable | Continue protocol |
| PSA increase >0.75/year | Investigate; urology referral |
| PSA >4.0 | Urology evaluation before continuing |
| Any prostate symptoms | Evaluate promptly |

*Note: Growth factors (including Follistatin, TB-500) are contraindicated with prostate cancer history.*

---

## IGF-1 Targets (Tesamorelin)

| Status | IGF-1 Range | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Optimal | 150-250 ng/mL | Continue current dosing |
| Elevated | >300 ng/mL | Reduce Tesamorelin dose |
| Supraphysiologic | >400 ng/mL | Stop Tesamorelin; retest in 4 weeks |

---

## Experimental Compound Monitoring

The following compounds have limited human safety data and require enhanced vigilance:

| Compound | Key Monitoring Points |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Follistatin-344** | Cardiac symptoms, asymmetric muscle changes, duration compliance |
| **Dihexa** | Mood changes, cognitive effects, sleep quality, cycle compliance |
| **TB-500** | Cancer screening current, healing response, angiogenic concerns |

---

## Pre-Procedure Checklist

| Compound | Action Before Procedure |
|----------|------------------------|
| Metformin | Hold 48h before/after IV contrast |
| TB-500/BPC-157 | Discuss timing with surgeon (may help healing but inform them) |
