## Mandatory Safety Bloodwork

Complete the following bloodwork at **BASELINE** (before starting), **WEEK 8**, and **WEEK 16**. Additional testing if symptoms arise.

---

## Core Safety Panel (Mandatory)

| Test | What It Monitors | Red Flags |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Complete Blood Count (CBC) | Red cells, white cells, platelets, haemoglobin | Anaemia, infection signs, clotting issues |
| Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) | Electrolytes, glucose, kidney, liver function | Organ dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance |
| Fasting Glucose | Blood sugar control | >100 mg/dL fasting = prediabetic range |
| Fasting Insulin | Insulin resistance | Elevated = metabolic dysfunction |
| HbA1c | 3-month glucose average | >5.7% = prediabetic; >6.5% = diabetic |
| Liver Function (ALT, AST, GGT) | Liver health and metabolism | >2x upper limit = concern; >3x = stop protocol |
| Kidney Function (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) | Kidney filtration | eGFR <60 = caution; <30 = contraindicated |
| Lipid Panel (TC, LDL, HDL, TG) | Cardiovascular risk | Significant changes from baseline = evaluate |
| ApoB | Atherogenic particle count | Critical for Repatha monitoring |
| IGF-1 | GH axis response (HGH + Tesamorelin) | Supraphysiologic levels = reduce dose |
| TSH | Thyroid function | <0.4 or >4.0 = investigate further |

---

## Extended Panel (Recommended)

| DHEA-S | Adrenal function (critical — TRIIM core) | Age-appropriate upper range |
| Cortisol (AM) | Stress response | 10-20 μg/dL morning |
| Total Testosterone | Hormonal status | Age-appropriate upper quartile |
| Free Testosterone | Bioavailable testosterone | Age-appropriate range |
| Oestradiol | Oestrogen status | Gender-appropriate range |
| SHBG | Hormone binding | Helps interpret free hormone levels |
| PSA (Men >40) | Prostate monitoring | <4.0 ng/mL; track changes |
| Uric Acid | Gout risk (Aspirin affects levels) | <7 mg/dL |

---

## Protocol-Specific Monitoring

### HGH (rhGH) — TRIIM Core
| Marker | Target | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| IGF-1 | 150-250 ng/mL | >300 = reduce dose; >400 = stop |
| Fasting Glucose | <100 mg/dL | Monitor insulin resistance |
| HbA1c | <5.7% | GH affects glucose metabolism |
| Joint Pain, Oedema | None | Reduce dose if present |

### Rapamycin — Weekly Dosing
| Monitoring | Frequency | Concern |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Mouth sores | Ongoing | Common; usually mild |
| Signs of infection | Ongoing | Immunosuppressive |
| Wound healing | Pre-surgery | Hold 1-2 weeks before surgery |
| Lipid panel | Each draw | May affect lipids |

### Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) — Critical
| Consideration | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **Opioid use** | **CONTRAINDICATED** — will precipitate withdrawal |
| Surgery planned | Stop LDN 3-5 days before (opioid anesthesia) |
| Vivid dreams | Common first 1-2 weeks; usually resolves |
| Sleep disturbance | Take earlier in evening if persistent |

### Low-Dose Aspirin
| Monitoring | Action |
|------------|--------|
| GI symptoms | Monitor for dyspepsia, dark stools |
| Unusual bleeding/bruising | May indicate bleeding risk |
| Pre-surgery | Hold 7 days before (discuss with surgeon) |

### Acarbose — Glucose Monitoring
| Marker | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Postprandial glucose | Should be blunted |
| GI symptoms | Flatulence/bloating very common initially |
| Hypoglycaemia | Keep glucose tablets (sucrose won't work) |

### Repatha (PCSK9i) — Cardiovascular
| Marker | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| LDL-C | <55 mg/dL | Aggressive for CV reversal |
| ApoB | <65 mg/dL | Better CV predictor |
| Lp(a) | Baseline only | Genetic; may reduce 20-30% |
| Injection site | Monitor | Rotate sites |

### 17-alpha Estradiol (Males Only)
| Monitoring | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Oestradiol | Monitor; should remain stable |
| Feminisation signs | Should not occur (non-feminising) |
| Testosterone | Requires intact T for efficacy |

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

*For comprehensive tracking:*

| Test | What It Measures | Use Case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Biological Age Testing (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation-based biological age | Track aging rate; assess protocol efficacy |
| GlycanAge | Glycan-based biological age | Alternative/complementary to methylation |
| Telomere Length | Chromosome end-cap length | Baseline + post-Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Comprehensive hormone metabolites | Deep hormonal and adrenal analysis |
| Organic Acids Test (OAT) | Mitochondrial function, nutrient status | Assess cellular metabolism |
| Oxidised LDL | Cardiovascular oxidative stress | More predictive than standard LDL |
| Lp(a) | Genetic cardiovascular risk | One-time test; informs risk profile |
| Fasting Insulin + HOMA-IR | Insulin resistance calculation | Metabolic health assessment |
| Inflammatory Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) | Detailed inflammation profile | If hsCRP elevated or autoimmune concerns |
| Cystatin C | Sensitive kidney function | More accurate than creatinine in some cases |
| GDF-15 | Aging and mitochondrial stress | Emerging longevity biomarker |

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core Safety + Extended + ApoB/Lp(a) | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |

| **WEEK 8** | Core Safety Panel + Extended Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1 | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core Safety + Extended + Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

## IGF-1 Targets (HGH + Tesamorelin)

| Status | IGF-1 Range | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Optimal | 150-250 ng/mL | Continue current dosing |
| Elevated | >300 ng/mL | Reduce HGH/Tesamorelin dose |
| Supraphysiologic | >400 ng/mL | Stop GH compounds; retest in 4 weeks |

## Key Monitoring Markers by Goal

### Thymus Regeneration (TRIIM)
- IGF-1, DHEA-S, CBC with differential (lymphocyte subsets), biological age clock
- Thymic imaging if available (MRI/CT chest)

### Cardiovascular Reversal
- ApoB, LDL-C, Lp(a), hsCRP, coronary calcium score (annual)
- Consider carotid IMT or CT angiography

### Metabolic Health
- Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR
- Monitor Acarbose efficacy via postprandial glucose

### Immune Function
- CBC with differential, lymphocyte subsets
- Monitor for infections (Rapamycin immunosuppression)

### Longevity Tracking
- Biological age (TruDiagnostic), telomere length, GDF-15

### Oncoprotective Monitoring
- Routine age-appropriate cancer screening
- Any new lumps, unexplained weight loss, bleeding = investigate

## Pre-Procedure Checklist

| Compound | Action Before Procedure |
|----------|------------------------|
| Rapamycin | Hold 1-2 weeks before surgery |
| LDN | Stop 3-5 days before (if opioid anesthesia needed) |
| Aspirin | Hold 7 days before (discuss with surgeon) |
| Metformin | Hold 48h before/after IV contrast |

## Sex-Specific Monitoring Notes

### Males
- PSA mandatory if >40 years

### Females
- Cycle phase testing for hormones (see Athena monitoring for details)
- Iron/Ferritin (menstruating women)
- Mammography and gynaecological screening per age guidelines
