## Mandatory Safety Bloodwork

Complete the following bloodwork at **BASELINE** (before starting), **WEEK 8**, and **WEEK 16**. Additional testing if symptoms arise.

---

## Core Safety Panel (Mandatory)

| Test | What It Monitors | Red Flags |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Complete Blood Count (CBC) | Red cells, white cells, platelets, haemoglobin | Anaemia, infection signs, clotting issues |
| Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) | Electrolytes, glucose, kidney, liver function | Organ dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance |
| Fasting Glucose | Blood sugar control | >100 mg/dL fasting = prediabetic range |
| Fasting Insulin | Insulin resistance | Elevated = metabolic dysfunction |
| HbA1c | 3-month glucose average | >5.7% = prediabetic; >6.5% = diabetic |
| Liver Function (ALT, AST, GGT) | Liver health and metabolism | >2x upper limit = concern; >3x = stop protocol |
| Kidney Function (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) | Kidney filtration | eGFR <60 = caution; <30 = contraindicated |
| Lipid Panel (TC, LDL, HDL, TG) | Cardiovascular risk | Significant changes from baseline = evaluate |
| IGF-1 | GH axis response | Supraphysiologic levels = reduce GH peptide dose |
| TSH | Thyroid function | <0.4 or >4.0 = investigate further |

---

## Extended Panel (Recommended)

| Test | Purpose | Optimal Range |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Free T3, Free T4 | Complete thyroid picture | Mid-range of reference |
| hsCRP | Systemic inflammation | <1.0 mg/L ideal; <3.0 acceptable |
| Homocysteine | Cardiovascular/methylation | <10 μmol/L |
| Vitamin D (25-OH) | Immune, bone, overall health | 50-80 ng/mL |
| Ferritin | Iron stores | 50-150 ng/mL (men); 30-100 (women) |
| DHEA-S | Adrenal function | Age-appropriate range |
| Cortisol (AM) | Stress response | 10-20 μg/dL morning |
| Total Testosterone | Hormonal status | Age-appropriate upper quartile |
| Free Testosterone | Bioavailable testosterone | Age-appropriate range |
| Estradiol | Oestrogen status | Gender-appropriate range |
| SHBG | Hormone binding | Helps interpret free hormone levels |
| PSA (Men >40) | Prostate monitoring | <4.0 ng/mL; track changes |

## Advanced Longevity Panel (Optional)

*For comprehensive tracking:*

| Test | What It Measures | Use Case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Biological Age Testing (TruDiagnostic) | DNA methylation-based biological age | Track aging rate; assess protocol efficacy |
| GlycanAge | Glycan-based biological age | Alternative/complementary to methylation |
| Telomere Length | Chromosome end-cap length | Baseline + post-Epithalon comparison |
| DUTCH Complete | Comprehensive hormone metabolites | Deep hormonal and adrenal analysis |
| Organic Acids Test (OAT) | Mitochondrial function, nutrient status | Assess cellular metabolism |
| Oxidised LDL | Cardiovascular oxidative stress | More predictive than standard LDL |
| Lp(a) | Genetic cardiovascular risk | One-time test; informs risk profile |
| ApoB | Atherogenic particle count | Better CV predictor than LDL-C |
| Fasting Insulin + HOMA-IR | Insulin resistance calculation | Metabolic health assessment |
| Inflammatory Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) | Detailed inflammation profile | If hsCRP elevated or autoimmune concerns |
| Cystatin C | Sensitive kidney function | More accurate than creatinine in some cases |
| GDF-15 | Aging and mitochondrial stress | Emerging longevity biomarker |

## Recommended Testing Schedule

| Timepoint | Tests Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **BASELINE** (Before Starting) | Core Safety Panel + Extended Panel | Establish baseline; identify contraindications |
| **WEEK 4** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1 | Early safety check if concerns |
| **WEEK 8** | Core Safety Panel + Extended Panel | Mid-protocol assessment |
| **WEEK 12** (Optional) | Glucose, Liver enzymes, IGF-1 | Continued monitoring |
| **WEEK 16** | Core Safety Panel + Extended + Longevity | End-of-protocol comprehensive assessment |
| **POST-PROTOCOL** (4-8 weeks after) | Core Safety Panel | Ensure parameters normalise |

---

## IGF-1 Targets

| Status | IGF-1 Range | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Optimal | 150-250 ng/mL | Continue current dosing |
| Elevated | >300 ng/mL | Reduce GH peptide dose |
| Supraphysiologic | >400 ng/mL | Stop GH peptides; retest in 4 weeks |

---

## Key Monitoring Markers by Goal

### Thymus Regeneration (TRIIM)
- IGF-1, DHEA-S, CBC with differential, biological age clock

### Cardiovascular Reversal
- ApoB, LDL, Lp(a), hsCRP, coronary calcium score (annual)

### Metabolic Health
- Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR

### Longevity Tracking
- Biological age (TruDiagnostic), telomere length, GDF-15
