# PROMETHEUS PROTOCOL

**Duration:** 12-16 Weeks (cyclical)
**Target:** Men and Women
**Philosophy:** Aggressive biological age reversal through multi-pathway intervention

**Related:** [Safety Considerations](prometheus-safety.md) | [Monitoring & Bloodwork](prometheus-monitoring.md)

Prometheus was the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity — punished eternally for daring to breach the boundary between mortal limitation and divine capability. The Prometheus Protocol embodies that same defiance: an aggressive, evidence-based assault on biological aging that pushes beyond conservative margins. Built on the TRIIM trial's demonstrated 2.5-year epigenetic age reversal, the NIA Interventions Testing Program's gold-standard lifespan compounds, and PCSK9 inhibition for cardiovascular rejuvenation, this protocol is for those who accept comprehensive monitoring in exchange for magnitude of effect. Peptide selection explicitly minimises oncogenic risk while an oncoprotective pharmaceutical stack (Metformin, Rapamycin, Low-Dose Aspirin, LDN) counterbalances the theoretical concerns of GH-pathway interventions. This is not optimisation — it is reversal.

## RATIONALE

The Prometheus Protocol represents the most aggressive evidence-based approach to biological age reversal, built on three pillars: the TRIIM trial's demonstrated 2.5-year epigenetic age reversal through HGH + DHEA + Metformin thymus regeneration; the NIA Interventions Testing Program's gold-standard lifespan compounds (Rapamycin, Acarbose, 17-alpha Estradiol); and PCSK9 inhibition for cardiovascular aging reversal.

The pharmaceutical stack targets aging through nine distinct mechanisms: mTOR inhibition (Rapamycin), AMPK activation (Metformin), alpha-glucosidase inhibition (Acarbose), thymic regeneration (HGH + Thymalin), metabolic optimization (17-alpha Estradiol, Tirzepatide), cardiovascular reversal (PCSK9i), senescent cell clearance (Procyanidin C1), and oncoprotective intervention (Low-Dose Aspirin + LDN). Unlike typical protocols, this includes ITP-validated 17-alpha Estradiol — a "non-feminizing" estrogen that extends male lifespan by 19% through metabolic pathways requiring intact testosterone. The oncoprotective layer adds Low-Dose Aspirin (13% CRC reduction in 2.1M patient study) and Low-Dose Naltrexone (immune modulation, NK cell enhancement, TLR4 antagonism) to counterbalance the theoretical oncogenic concerns of GH-pathway interventions.

Peptide selection explicitly minimizes oncogenic risk. BPC-157, TB-500, and Follistatin are excluded due to angiogenic and proliferative concerns. The remaining peptides target safe pathways: Epithalon (telomerase — may be protective), Thymalin (immune), Thymosin Alpha-1 (immune modulation with 9% mortality reduction in sepsis meta-analysis, 35+ country approvals, FDA orphan drug — enhances tumor surveillance without stimulating growth), SS-31 and MOTS-c (mitochondrial), NAD+ (sirtuins), KPV (anti-inflammatory without angiogenic risk), and Selank (stress resilience). Tesamorelin is retained as the only GH-pathway peptide due to its FDA approval and targeted VAT reduction.

The supplement stack combines evidence-based longevity compounds (Ca-AKG, Creatine, Glycine, Taurine, Lithium) with autophagy inducers (Spermidine, Fisetin) and protective methylation support (TMG — critical given Metformin's B12/folate depletion). This is designed for individuals with comprehensive monitoring who prioritise magnitude of effect over conservative safety margins.
