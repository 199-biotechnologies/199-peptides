# PROMETHEUS PROTOCOL

**Duration:** 12-16 Weeks (cyclical)
**Target:** Men and Women
**Philosophy:** Aggressive biological age reversal through multi-pathway intervention

---

Prometheus was the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity — punished eternally for daring to breach the boundary between mortal limitation and divine capability. The Prometheus Protocol embodies that same defiance: an aggressive, evidence-based assault on biological aging that pushes beyond conservative margins. Built on the TRIIM trial's demonstrated 2.5-year epigenetic age reversal, the NIA Interventions Testing Program's gold-standard lifespan compounds, and PCSK9 inhibition for cardiovascular rejuvenation, this protocol is for those who accept comprehensive monitoring in exchange for magnitude of effect. Peptide selection explicitly minimises oncogenic risk while an oncoprotective pharmaceutical stack (Metformin, Rapamycin, Low-Dose Aspirin, LDN) counterbalances the theoretical concerns of GH-pathway interventions. This is not optimisation — it is reversal.

## RATIONALE

The Prometheus Protocol represents the most aggressive evidence-based approach to biological age reversal, built on three pillars: the TRIIM trial's demonstrated 2.5-year epigenetic age reversal through HGH + DHEA + Metformin thymus regeneration; the NIA Interventions Testing Program's gold-standard lifespan compounds (Rapamycin, Acarbose, 17-alpha Estradiol); and PCSK9 inhibition for cardiovascular aging reversal.

The pharmaceutical stack targets aging through nine distinct mechanisms: mTOR inhibition (Rapamycin), AMPK activation (Metformin), alpha-glucosidase inhibition (Acarbose), thymic regeneration (HGH + Thymalin), metabolic optimization (17-alpha Estradiol, Tirzepatide), cardiovascular reversal (PCSK9i), senescent cell clearance (Procyanidin C1), and oncoprotective intervention (Low-Dose Aspirin + LDN). Unlike typical protocols, this includes ITP-validated 17-alpha Estradiol — a "non-feminizing" estrogen that extends male lifespan by 19% through metabolic pathways requiring intact testosterone. The oncoprotective layer adds Low-Dose Aspirin (13% CRC reduction in 2.1M patient study) and Low-Dose Naltrexone (immune modulation, NK cell enhancement, TLR4 antagonism) to counterbalance the theoretical oncogenic concerns of GH-pathway interventions.

Peptide selection explicitly minimizes oncogenic risk. BPC-157, TB-500, and Follistatin are excluded due to angiogenic and proliferative concerns. The remaining peptides target safe pathways: Epithalon (telomerase — may be protective), Thymalin (immune), Thymosin Alpha-1 (immune modulation with 9% mortality reduction in sepsis meta-analysis, 35+ country approvals, FDA orphan drug — enhances tumor surveillance without stimulating growth), SS-31 and MOTS-c (mitochondrial), NAD+ (sirtuins), KPV (anti-inflammatory without angiogenic risk), and Selank (stress resilience). Tesamorelin is retained as the only GH-pathway peptide due to its FDA approval and targeted VAT reduction.

The supplement stack combines Bryan Johnson's validated longevity compounds (Ca-AKG, Creatine, Glycine, Taurine, Lithium) with autophagy inducers (Spermidine, Fisetin) and protective methylation support (TMG — critical given Metformin's B12/folate depletion). This is designed for individuals with comprehensive monitoring who prioritize magnitude of effect over conservative safety margins.

## NOTES

### Why 17-alpha Estradiol

17aE2 is a stereoisomer of regular estradiol that:
- Does NOT feminize (minimal ER activation)
- Extends male mouse lifespan by 19% (ITP-validated)
- Requires intact testosterone for efficacy
- Acts through metabolic pathways in liver/hypothalamus
- Magnitude comparable to rapamycin and caloric restriction

### HGH Safety with Oncogenic Concerns

HGH/IGF-1 pathway carries theoretical cancer risk. Mitigations:
- Use lowest effective dose (1-2 IU, titrate slowly)
- Combine with Metformin (counters IGF-1 effects)
- Rapamycin provides mTOR counterbalance
- Rigorous cancer screening protocol
- Benefits (thymus regeneration, immune surveillance) may offset risk

### Acarbose Note

Works significantly better in males (22% lifespan) than females (5%). Women may still benefit from glucose control effects but should not expect equivalent lifespan extension.

### Low-Dose Aspirin (Oncoprotective)

Evidence for cancer risk reduction:
- **Norwegian study (n=2.1M)**: 13% lower colorectal cancer risk
- **NEJM 2025**: 49% lower CRC recurrence in PI3K-mutated tumors
- **Harvard 2024**: 10-year CRC incidence 1.98% vs 2.95% (aspirin vs no aspirin)
- Mechanism: COX-2 inhibition, blocks prostaglandins, anti-inflammatory
- Benefits emerge after 5-10+ years of consistent use
- Consider: GI bleeding risk (mitigated by low dose, monitor)

### Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN)

LDN (1.5-4.5mg nightly) works through paradoxical opioid receptor blockade:
- Brief receptor blockade → compensatory endorphin upregulation
- Enhanced NK cell activity and immune surveillance
- Anti-proliferative effects in various cancer cell lines
- Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonism → reduced inflammation
- Off-label use for autoimmune conditions, cancer adjunct
- Timing: Take at bedtime (endorphin surge occurs overnight)
- Titration: Start 1.5mg, increase by 0.5mg weekly to 4.5mg
- Generally well-tolerated; vivid dreams common initially

### Thymosin Alpha-1 + Thymalin Synergy

These are NOT redundant — they work through different mechanisms:
- **Thymalin**: Polypeptide complex from thymus extract (Khavinson bioregulator), pulsed dosing
- **Thymosin Alpha-1**: Single synthetic 28-amino acid peptide, continuous dosing
- Ta1 enhances tumor surveillance without stimulating growth (critical for oncogenic risk minimization)
- 4,000-patient meta-analysis: 9% absolute mortality reduction in sepsis
- 35+ country approvals, FDA orphan drug designation

### Cycling

| Compound | Cycling |
|----------|---------|
| Epithalon | 20 days on, 4-6 months off |
| Thymalin | 10-14 days on, 4-6 months off |
| Thymosin Alpha-1 | Continuous (2x/week) |
| Procyanidin C1 | 3 days/month |
| Fisetin | 2 days/month |
| HGH | Continuous with monitoring |
| Rapamycin | Weekly, continuous |
| Low-Dose Aspirin | Daily, continuous |
| LDN | Nightly, continuous (titrate up from 1.5mg) |

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES (Based on Research)

| Metric | Expected Change | Source |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Epigenetic Age | -2 to -3 years/year | TRIIM |
| LDL/ApoB | -50-70% | PCSK9i trials |
| Visceral Fat | -15-25% | Tesamorelin + Tirzepatide |
| Thymic Fat | Reduction | TRIIM |
| Immune Function | Improved T-cell diversity | TRIIM |
| Coronary Plaque | Regression possible | PCSK9i + aggressive lipids |

*Aggressive experimental protocol for men and women. Requires comprehensive monitoring and qualified medical supervision. Not suitable for those with cancer history or high cancer risk. Some compounds (17-alpha Estradiol, Acarbose) have stronger effects in males.*
