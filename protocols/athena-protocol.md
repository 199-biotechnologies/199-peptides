## RATIONALE

The Athena Protocol addresses the unique physiological needs of women through mechanistically synergistic interventions. The hormonal foundation combines bioidentical Estradiol, Progesterone, and low-dose Testosterone with Cabergoline for prolactin optimization and Kisspeptin for GnRH axis support. Rapamycin (2-5mg weekly) directly targets ovarian aging — the VIBRANT trial showed 20% slower ovarian aging with potential for 5 extra fertile years. DIM supports healthy estrogen metabolism, critical when on HRT.

The appearance stack leverages GHK-Cu (28% collagen increase in RCT data) with oral collagen peptides and Tesamorelin-driven GH release. BPC-157 supports the gut-hormone axis — gut health drives hormone metabolism. The cognitive-mood axis pairs Semax (BDNF, dopaminergic activation) with Selank (anxiolytic without sedation or dependence), while Creatine provides overlooked cognitive and bone density benefits for women. Tirzepatide adds orthogonal GLP-1/GIP control for body composition.

The "Holy Grail" mitochondrial stack (SS-31 + MOTS-c + NAD+ + CoQ10) addresses cellular energy at four levels: repair existing mitochondria, build new ones, restore the critical NAD+ substrate that declines sharply at menopause, and fuel the electron transport chain. Myo-Inositol provides insulin sensitivity and egg quality support with strong evidence for women. Longevity vectors include Rapamycin (mTOR), Epithalon (telomerase), Procyanidin C1 (senolytic), NAD+ (cellular energy), and Metformin (AMPK) — attacking aging through five non-redundant pathways.

## NOTES

### Pre-Menopausal Considerations
- Kisspeptin and HRT doses adjusted per cycle phase
- PT-141 can be used for libido regardless of hormonal status
- Cabergoline particularly useful if elevated prolactin or post-pill amenorrhea

### Bone Density Support
- Estradiol is foundation for bone protection
- Vitamin D3 + K2 combination directs calcium appropriately
- Weight-bearing exercise synergizes with protocol

### Hair & Nails
- GHK-Cu: Proven hair growth effects via Wnt signaling
- Biotin: Keratin support
- Collagen peptides: Structural support

### Cycle Timing (for pulsed compounds)
- Epithalon: 10-20 days, 2-3x/year
- Procyanidin C1: 3 consecutive days/month
- Rapamycin: Start 2mg weekly, increase to 5mg over time
