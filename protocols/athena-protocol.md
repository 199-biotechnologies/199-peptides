## RATIONALE

The Athena Protocol addresses the unique physiological needs of women through mechanistically synergistic interventions. The hormonal foundation combines bioidentical Estradiol, Progesterone, and low-dose Testosterone with Cabergoline for prolactin optimization and Kisspeptin for GnRH axis support. This addresses the cascade of changes that occur during perimenopause and beyond while remaining applicable to pre-menopausal women seeking optimization.

The appearance stack leverages GHK-Cu (28% collagen increase in RCT data) with oral collagen peptides, Tesamorelin-driven GH release, and GLA from Evening Primrose Oil for hormonal skin support. The cognitive-mood axis pairs Semax (BDNF, dopaminergic activation) with Selank (anxiolytic without sedation or dependence) — focus without anxiety, calm without fog. Estradiol itself provides significant neuroprotection.

The "Holy Grail" mitochondrial stack (SS-31 + MOTS-c + CoQ10) addresses cellular energy at multiple levels: repair existing mitochondria, build new ones, fuel the electron transport chain. Sleep optimization combines DSIP, Progesterone's GABAergic effects, Magnesium, and Glycine. Longevity vectors include Epithalon (telomerase), Thymalin (immune restoration), Ca-AKG, and Metformin — attacking aging through multiple non-redundant pathways.

## NOTES

### Pre-Menopausal Considerations
- Kisspeptin and HRT doses adjusted per cycle phase
- PT-141 can be used for libido regardless of hormonal status
- Cabergoline particularly useful if elevated prolactin or post-pill amenorrhea

### Bone Density Support
- Estradiol is foundation for bone protection
- Vitamin D3 + K2 combination directs calcium appropriately
- Weight-bearing exercise synergizes with protocol

### Hair & Nails
- GHK-Cu: Proven hair growth effects via Wnt signaling
- Biotin: Keratin support
- Collagen peptides: Structural support

### Cycle Timing (for pulsed compounds)
- Epithalon: 10-20 days, 2-3x/year
- Thymalin: 10-14 days, 2x/year (pre-flu season ideal)
