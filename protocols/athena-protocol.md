# ATHENA PROTOCOL

**Duration:** 16 Weeks
**Target:** Women
**Philosophy:** Female-specific optimisation addressing hormonal, structural, and cognitive domains across life phases

---

Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategic warfare, and craft — revered not for brute force but for intelligence, grace, and the ability to navigate complexity. The Athena Protocol addresses the unique physiological landscape of women: hormonal rhythms that shift across decades, bone density that requires active protection, skin and collagen that respond to targeted intervention, and a brain that thrives on specific neurochemical support. This protocol recognises that female optimisation isn't a modified male protocol — it requires compounds selected for women's biology, from ovarian aging interventions (Rapamycin, NAD+) to estrogen metabolism support (DIM) to the anxiolytic-without-sedation profile that women often need (Selank). Longevity here means thriving, not merely surviving.

## RATIONALE

The Athena Protocol addresses the unique physiological needs of women through mechanistically synergistic interventions. The hormonal foundation combines bioidentical Estradiol, Progesterone, and low-dose Testosterone with Cabergoline for prolactin optimization and Kisspeptin for GnRH axis support. Rapamycin (2-5mg weekly) directly targets ovarian aging — the VIBRANT trial showed 20% slower ovarian aging with potential for 5 extra fertile years. DIM supports healthy estrogen metabolism, critical when on HRT.

The appearance stack leverages GHK-Cu (28% collagen increase in RCT data) with oral collagen peptides and Tesamorelin-driven GH release. BPC-157 supports the gut-hormone axis — gut health drives hormone metabolism. The cognitive-mood axis pairs Semax (BDNF, dopaminergic activation) with Selank (anxiolytic without sedation or dependence), while Creatine provides overlooked cognitive and bone density benefits for women. Tirzepatide adds orthogonal GLP-1/GIP control for body composition.

The "Holy Grail" mitochondrial stack (SS-31 + MOTS-c + NAD+ + CoQ10) addresses cellular energy at four levels: repair existing mitochondria, build new ones, restore the critical NAD+ substrate that declines sharply at menopause, and fuel the electron transport chain. Myo-Inositol provides insulin sensitivity and egg quality support with strong evidence for women. The bone density stack (Estradiol + Vitamin D3 + K2 + Boron + Magnesium + Creatine) addresses the critical concern of postmenopausal bone loss through six synergistic mechanisms — Boron alone extends Vitamin D3 half-life by 20% while stimulating osteoblast differentiation via RUNX2. Longevity vectors include Rapamycin (mTOR), Epithalon (telomerase), NAD+ (cellular energy), and Metformin (AMPK) — attacking aging through four non-redundant pathways. Procyanidin C1 available as optional senolytic addon.
