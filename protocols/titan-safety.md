**Related:** [Titan Protocol](titan-protocol.md) | [Monitoring & Bloodwork](titan-monitoring.md)

---

## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH/growth factors, TB-500, Follistatin may stimulate tumour growth or angiogenesis |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH worsens retinal neovascularisation; TB-500 angiogenic |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH secretagogues may exacerbate |
| Prostate Cancer History | Growth factors contraindicated; TB-500/Follistatin angiogenic risk |
| Age <18 | Not studied in paediatrics |
| Cardiac Tumours or Cardiac Myxoma | TB-500 angiogenic properties |

---

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with caution:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes | GH affects glucose; Metformin helps but monitor closely |
| Cardiovascular Disease | Monitor BP, heart rate; Follistatin theoretical cardiac concern (myostatin protects heart) |
| BPH / Elevated PSA | Monitor PSA closely; growth factors caution |
| Bleeding Disorders / Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation; injection complications |
| Psychiatric Conditions | Dihexa, Semax affect cognition/mood — monitor closely |
| Elderly >70 | Start lower doses; increased GH sensitivity |
| History of Excessive Scarring/Fibrosis | Follistatin affects tissue remodeling |
| Heart Failure | Follistatin — myostatin has cardioprotective effects; use with caution |

---

## Potential Side Effects

| Category | Effects | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Injection Site** | Redness, bruising, pain | Rotate sites; if >48h contact provider |
| **GH-Related** | Water retention, joint pain, carpal tunnel | Reduce Tesamorelin dose; severe = stop |
| **Metabolic** | Blood sugar changes | Monitor glucose; Metformin helps |
| **Cardiovascular** | BP changes, palpitations | Monitor; chest pain = seek care |
| **Neurological** | Headache, mood changes, vivid dreams | See cognitive peptide section below |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, breathing difficulty | **STOP**; emergency care if severe |

## Compound-Specific Considerations

### Follistatin-344
- **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL** — very limited human safety data
- Blocks myostatin → removes genetic ceiling on muscle growth
- **Theoretical cardiac concern**: Myostatin also protects heart from hypertrophy
- Potential for uncontrolled/asymmetric muscle growth
- Pulsed dosing only (10-14 days, 2 courses per protocol)
- **Not recommended** with cardiac conditions
- Monitor cardiac function if any symptoms

### Dihexa
- **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL** — minimal human safety data
- HGF/c-Met pathway activation — theoretical oncogenic concerns at high/prolonged doses
- Cognitive effects may be **persistent** (structural brain changes)
- Start low (10mg), assess tolerance before increasing
- Cycle on/off (4-6 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off)
- Monitor mood, cognition, sleep carefully
- Discontinue if concerning neurological symptoms

### TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)
- **Angiogenic** — promotes blood vessel formation
- **Explicitly contraindicated with any cancer history** — may promote tumour vascularisation
- Beneficial for injury healing, flexibility
- Pulsed dosing: loading (2x/week) then maintenance (1x/week)
- Generally well-tolerated when used appropriately

### BPC-157
- May affect coagulation — caution with anticoagulants/bleeding disorders
- Generally very well-tolerated
- Supports gut health and tissue repair
- Local injection near injury site often used

### Semax
- Crosses blood-brain barrier; BDNF enhancement
- Generally well-tolerated
- Possible: overstimulation, irritability — reduce dose
- Synergises with Dihexa for cognitive enhancement

### GHK-Cu
- Excellent safety profile
- Rarely: injection site reactions
- Supports collagen, skin elasticity, wound healing
- Very low systemic risk

### Thymalin
- Flu-like symptoms possible during 10-14 day course
- Generally well-tolerated
- Immune restoration effects
- Pulsed dosing (2-3x/year)

### DSIP
- Vivid dreams common — usually positive
- Rarely: next-day grogginess
- Supports sleep architecture and GH pulsatility

### Alpha-GPC
- Generally very safe
- Rare: fishy body odour at high doses
- Theoretical TMAO concern (likely minimal at protocol doses)
- Supports acetylcholine for cognition

## Male-Specific Considerations

### Testosterone & GH Interaction
- GH peptides (Tesamorelin) enhance testosterone effects
- Monitor haematocrit — can increase with both TRT and GH
- If on TRT, inform provider — doses may need adjustment
- Synergistic for body composition

### Prostate Health
- **PSA monitoring mandatory for men >40**
- Any PSA increase >0.75 ng/mL/year requires investigation
- Growth factors (including Follistatin, TB-500) contraindicated with prostate cancer history
- BPH is relative contraindication — monitor symptoms

### Haematocrit Concerns
- GH + Testosterone can elevate haematocrit significantly
- **>52% requires intervention** (phlebotomy, dose reduction)
- **>54% = stop protocol; urgent medical review**
- Monitor at each blood draw

### Fertility Considerations
- Exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis
- If fertility desired, discuss alternatives (hCG, clomiphene, enclomiphene)
- GH peptides generally neutral on fertility
- Follistatin effects on fertility unknown

### Hair Loss Considerations
- Testosterone may accelerate male pattern baldness in predisposed individuals
- Finasteride/Dutasteride can be used but affects DHT
- GHK-Cu may support hair via Wnt signalling

## Drug Interactions

| Medication | Consideration |
|------------|---------------|
| Testosterone (TRT) | Monitor haematocrit; GH may enhance effects |
| PDE5 Inhibitors (Viagra, etc.) | Generally safe; monitor BP |
| Finasteride/Dutasteride | May affect DHT; monitor hair/prostate outcomes |
| Alpha Blockers (BPH) | Monitor BP with peptides |
| Aromatase Inhibitors | Monitor oestrogen levels closely |
| Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation; monitor INR |
| Anticholinergics | Oppose Alpha-GPC effects |
| CNS Medications | Dihexa, Semax affect neurotransmitters — unknown interactions; use caution |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h before/after contrast imaging |
| Immunosuppressants | Thymalin modulates immunity — careful monitoring |

## Experimental Compound Warning

**The following compounds in this protocol have very limited human safety data:**

| Compound | Status | Key Concern |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Follistatin-344** | Experimental | Cardiac effects unknown; limited human trials |
| **Dihexa** | Experimental | Long-term neurological effects unknown; HGF/c-Met oncogenic potential |
| **TB-500** | Research compound | Angiogenic — cancer risk if pre-existing malignancy |

These compounds are included for their potential benefits but require:
- Informed consent acknowledging experimental status
- Enhanced monitoring
- Willingness to discontinue if concerns arise
- Understanding that long-term effects are unknown

---

## Pre-Procedure Considerations

| Procedure | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Surgery | Discuss TB-500/BPC-157 timing with surgeon (may help healing but inform them) |
| IV Contrast imaging | Hold Metformin 48h before and after |
| Prostate biopsy | Ensure PSA monitored; discuss protocol with urologist |

---

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe abdominal pain
- Spreading injection site infection
- Severe mood changes, confusion, or neurological symptoms
- Priapism (prolonged erection >4 hours)
- Signs of polycythaemia (headache, dizziness, flushing with high haematocrit)
