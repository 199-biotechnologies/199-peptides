# Titan Protocol — Safety Considerations

**Related:** [Titan Protocol](titan-protocol.md) | [Monitoring & Bloodwork](titan-monitoring.md)

---

## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH/growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH worsens retinal neovascularisation |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH secretagogues may exacerbate |
| Prostate Cancer History | Growth factors contraindicated |
| Age <18 | Not studied in paediatrics |

---

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with caution:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes | GH affects glucose; monitor closely |
| Cardiovascular Disease | Monitor BP, heart rate |
| BPH / Elevated PSA | Monitor PSA; growth factors caution |
| Bleeding Disorders | Injection complications; BPC may affect coagulation |
| Psychiatric Conditions | Cognitive peptides may affect mood |
| Elderly >70 | Start lower doses |

## Potential Side Effects

| Category | Effects | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Injection Site** | Redness, bruising, pain | Rotate sites; if >48h contact provider |
| **GH-Related** | Water retention, joint pain, carpal tunnel | Reduce dose; severe = stop GH peptides |
| **Metabolic** | Blood sugar changes | Monitor glucose |
| **Cardiovascular** | BP changes, palpitations | Monitor; chest pain = seek care |
| **Neurological** | Headache, mood changes, vivid dreams | Reduce cognitive peptides |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, breathing difficulty | **STOP**; emergency care if severe |

## Male-Specific Considerations

### Testosterone & GH Interaction
- GH peptides may enhance testosterone effects
- Monitor haematocrit (can increase with both)
- If on TRT, inform provider — doses may need adjustment

### Prostate Health
- PSA monitoring mandatory for men >40
- Any PSA increase >0.75 ng/mL/year requires investigation
- Growth factors contraindicated with prostate cancer history

### Haematocrit Concerns
- GH + Testosterone can elevate haematocrit
- >52% requires intervention (phlebotomy, dose reduction)
- Monitor at each blood draw

### Fertility Considerations
- Exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis
- If fertility desired, discuss alternatives (hCG, clomiphene)
- GH peptides generally neutral on fertility

## Drug Interactions — Male-Specific

| Medication | Consideration |
|------------|---------------|
| Testosterone (TRT) | Monitor haematocrit; GH may enhance effects |
| PDE5 Inhibitors (Viagra, etc.) | Generally safe; monitor BP |
| Finasteride/Dutasteride | May affect DHT; monitor hair/prostate outcomes |
| Alpha Blockers (BPH) | Monitor BP with peptides |
| Aromatase Inhibitors | Monitor oestrogen levels closely |

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe abdominal pain
- Spreading injection site infection
- Severe mood changes or confusion
