# Titan Protocol — Safety Considerations

---

## Absolute Contraindications

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | GH, TB-500, Follistatin may stimulate tumour growth/angiogenesis |
| Prostate Cancer History | Growth factors contraindicated |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance |
| Severe Liver Disease | Impaired metabolism |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH worsens retinal neovascularisation |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH secretagogues may exacerbate |
| Cardiac Tumours / Myxoma | TB-500 angiogenic |

---

## Relative Contraindications

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes | GH affects glucose; monitor closely |
| Cardiovascular Disease | Follistatin: myostatin is cardioprotective |
| Heart Failure | Follistatin caution |
| BPH / Elevated PSA | Monitor PSA; growth factors caution |
| Bleeding Disorders / Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation |
| Psychiatric Conditions | Dihexa, Semax affect mood/cognition |
| Elderly >70 | Lower starting doses |

## Critical Compound Warnings

### Experimental Status
| Compound | Key Concern |
|----------|-------------|
| **Follistatin-344** | Cardiac effects unknown; myostatin inhibition removes cardioprotection |
| **Dihexa** | HGF/c-Met oncogenic potential; persistent neurological effects |
| **TB-500** | Angiogenic — **explicitly contraindicated with any cancer history** |

### Follistatin-344
- Theoretical cardiac hypertrophy risk
- Pulsed dosing only (10-14 days)
- Discontinue if cardiac symptoms

### Dihexa
- Cognitive effects may be persistent (structural changes)
- Start 10mg; cycle 4-6 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off
- Discontinue if concerning neurological symptoms

### TB-500
- Angiogenic — may promote tumour vascularisation
- Beneficial for healing but contraindicated with malignancy

### BPC-157
- May affect coagulation — caution with anticoagulants

## Male-Specific Concerns

### Haematocrit (Critical)
| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >52% | Reduce GH/TRT; consider phlebotomy |
| >54% | **Stop protocol; urgent review** |

### Prostate
- PSA monitoring mandatory >40 years
- PSA increase >0.75 ng/mL/year requires investigation
- Growth factors contraindicated with prostate cancer history

### Fertility
- Exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis
- Discuss hCG/clomiphene if fertility desired

## Drug Interactions

| Medication | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| Anticoagulants | BPC-157 may affect coagulation; monitor INR |
| CNS Medications | Dihexa, Semax affect neurotransmitters — unknown interactions |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h before/after |
| Immunosuppressants | Thymalin modulates immunity |

---

## Pre-Procedure

| Procedure | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Surgery | Discuss TB-500/BPC-157 with surgeon |
| IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h |

## Emergency Signs

Seek emergency care if:
- Anaphylaxis
- Chest pain / shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot
- Spreading injection site infection
- Severe neurological symptoms
- Priapism >4 hours
- Polycythaemia symptoms (headache, dizziness, flushing) with high haematocrit
