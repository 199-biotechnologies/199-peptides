**Related:** [Prometheus Protocol](prometheus-protocol.md) | [Monitoring & Bloodwork](prometheus-monitoring.md)

---

## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer or History of Cancer | HGH, GH secretagogues, and growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Pregnancy or Breastfeeding | Safety not established; potential fetal/infant harm |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance; toxicity risk |
| Severe Liver Disease (Child-Pugh C) | Impaired metabolism; unpredictable effects; Rapamycin contraindicated |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH can worsen retinal neovascularisation |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH secretagogues may exacerbate |
| Known Hypersensitivity | To any peptide or component in the protocol |
| Age <18 Years | Not studied in paediatric populations |
| Current Opioid Use | **LDN blocks opioid receptors** — will precipitate withdrawal and block pain relief |
| Active GI Bleeding or Bleeding Disorders | Aspirin contraindicated; injection complications |

---

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with extreme caution / Medical clearance required:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes Mellitus | HGH and GH peptides affect glucose; Acarbose affects carbohydrate absorption; monitor closely, adjust medications |
| Cardiovascular Disease | Monitor BP, heart rate; Repatha beneficial but monitor |
| Autoimmune Conditions | Thymosin Alpha-1 may be beneficial but requires monitoring; Rapamycin immunosuppressive |
| Thyroid Disorders | GH can affect thyroid axis; monitor TSH, T3, T4 |
| History of Seizures | Some peptides cross BBB; neurological monitoring needed |
| Psychiatric Conditions | Selank affects mood; start low and monitor |
| Recent Surgery (<4 weeks) | Rapamycin impairs wound healing; consult surgeon |
| Elderly (>70 years) | Start at lower doses; increased sensitivity to GH effects |
| History of GI Ulcers | Aspirin may exacerbate; consider gastroprotection |
| Gout | Aspirin at low doses may increase uric acid |
| Immunocompromised | Rapamycin further suppresses immunity |

## Potential Side Effects & Monitoring Signs

| Category | Possible Effects | Action Required |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Injection Site** | Redness, swelling, bruising, pain, itching | Rotate sites; if persistent >48h, contact provider |
| **HGH/GH-Related** | Water retention, joint pain, carpal tunnel, numbness | Reduce dose; if severe, discontinue HGH/Tesamorelin |
| **Metabolic** | Blood sugar changes, increased appetite | Monitor glucose; adjust diet/medications |
| **Cardiovascular** | BP changes, palpitations, oedema | Monitor BP; seek care if chest pain/SOB |
| **Neurological** | Headache, dizziness, mood changes, vivid dreams | Reduce Selank if mood effects; LDN may cause vivid dreams initially |
| **Gastrointestinal (Acarbose)** | Flatulence, bloating, diarrhoea — **very common** | Start low dose; take with first bite of meals; usually improves over weeks |
| **Gastrointestinal (Aspirin)** | Dyspepsia, GI discomfort, rare bleeding | Take with food; monitor for dark stools |
| **Oral (Rapamycin)** | Mouth sores (aphthous ulcers) — common | Reduce dose; mouthwash may help; usually transient |
| **Immune (Thymosin)** | Flu-like symptoms, fatigue | Usually transient; reduce dose if persistent |
| **Immune (Rapamycin)** | Increased infection susceptibility | Monitor for infections; may need to pause if ill |
| **LDN-Related** | Vivid dreams, sleep disturbance (first 1-2 weeks) | Usually resolves; take earlier in evening if persistent |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, difficulty breathing | **STOP immediately**; seek emergency care if severe |

## Compound-Specific Considerations

### HGH (Recombinant Human Growth Hormone)
- More potent than GH-releasing peptides — requires careful IGF-1 monitoring
- Target IGF-1: 150-250 ng/mL; >300 = reduce dose; >400 = stop
- Risk of acromegaly features at excessive doses (rare at protocol doses)
- Combined with Metformin to mitigate insulin resistance

### Rapamycin
- **Immunosuppressive** — increased infection risk
- Mouth sores common (10-20%) — usually mild and transient
- **Delays wound healing** — hold 1-2 weeks before/after surgery
- Interacts with CYP3A4 inhibitors (see drug interactions)
- Take consistently with or without food (affects absorption)

### Low-Dose Aspirin
- GI bleeding risk — monitor for dark stools, unusual bruising
- Contraindicated with active bleeding, bleeding disorders
- Benefits emerge after years of consistent use (cancer protection)
- Consider gastroprotection if history of GI issues

### Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN)
- **CRITICAL: Blocks opioid receptors completely**
- Cannot use ANY opioid pain medications while on LDN
- If surgery planned, stop LDN 3-5 days before (opioid anesthesia/analgesia)
- Vivid dreams common first 1-2 weeks — usually resolves
- Start 1.5mg, titrate up by 0.5mg weekly to 4.5mg

### Acarbose
- GI side effects (gas, bloating) very common — start low
- Must take with first bite of carbohydrate-containing meal
- Keep glucose tablets available (sucrose won't work for hypoglycaemia with acarbose)
- Stronger lifespan effect in males (22%) vs females (5%)

### 17-alpha Estradiol
- **Males only** — no female lifespan benefit in ITP studies
- Non-feminising (minimal oestrogen receptor activation)
- Requires intact testosterone for efficacy
- Monitor standard hormone panel

### Procyanidin C1 / Fisetin (Senolytics)
- Pulsed dosing only (3 days/month; 2 days/month)
- May cause transient flu-like symptoms during clearance
- Best taken together for synergistic effect
- Do not use continuously

## Drug Interactions

| Medication Class | Interaction Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Opioids (ANY)** | **LDN blocks opioid receptors** | **CONTRAINDICATED** — stop LDN 3-5 days before if opioids needed |
| Anticoagulants (Warfarin, DOACs) | Aspirin increases bleeding risk | Monitor closely; may need dose adjustment; inform provider |
| NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, etc.) | Aspirin + NSAIDs = increased GI bleeding | Avoid combination; use paracetamol if needed |
| Insulin / Oral Hypoglycaemics | HGH, Acarbose affect glucose | Monitor closely; may need dose adjustment |
| **CYP3A4 Inhibitors** | Increase Rapamycin levels significantly | Grapefruit, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin — avoid or adjust Rapamycin dose |
| **CYP3A4 Inducers** | Decrease Rapamycin levels | Rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's Wort — may need higher Rapamycin dose |
| Corticosteroids | May counteract some peptide effects; both immunosuppressive with Rapamycin | Discuss timing and necessity with physician |
| Thyroid Medications | GH affects thyroid axis | Monitor thyroid function; adjust as needed |
| Immunosuppressants | Rapamycin + other immunosuppressants = additive risk | Requires careful monitoring |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Risk of lactic acidosis | Hold Metformin 48h before/after contrast imaging |
| CNS Medications | Selank affects neurotransmitters | Monitor for altered effects; start peptides low |
| Chemotherapy | **CONTRAINDICATED** — growth factors + cancer treatment | **DO NOT USE** during or shortly after chemo |
| Digestive Enzymes | May reduce Acarbose efficacy | Separate timing if both needed |

---

## Pre-Procedure Considerations

| Procedure | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Surgery (any) | Stop Rapamycin 1-2 weeks before; Stop LDN 3-5 days before; Stop Aspirin 7 days before (discuss with surgeon) |
| Dental procedures | Consider stopping Aspirin 3-5 days before if significant bleeding expected |
| IV Contrast imaging | Hold Metformin 48h before and after |
| Vaccinations | Rapamycin may reduce vaccine efficacy; discuss timing |

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe abdominal pain or black/bloody stools
- Signs of serious infection (high fever, severe illness) — especially on Rapamycin
- Spreading injection site infection
- Severe mood changes or confusion
- Symptoms of opioid withdrawal (if inadvertently took opioids with LDN)
