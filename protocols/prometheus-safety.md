# Prometheus Protocol — Safety Considerations

---

## Absolute Contraindications

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer / Cancer History | HGH and growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Pregnancy / Breastfeeding | Safety not established |
| **Current Opioid Use** | **LDN blocks opioid receptors — precipitates withdrawal** |
| Active GI Bleeding / Bleeding Disorders | Aspirin contraindicated |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired clearance; toxicity risk |
| Severe Liver Disease (Child-Pugh C) | Rapamycin contraindicated |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH worsens neovascularisation |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH may exacerbate |

---

## Relative Contraindications

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes | HGH, Acarbose affect glucose; monitor closely |
| History of GI Ulcers | Aspirin may exacerbate; gastroprotection |
| Gout | Low-dose Aspirin may increase uric acid |
| Recent Surgery (<4 weeks) | Rapamycin impairs wound healing |
| Immunocompromised | Rapamycin further suppresses immunity |
| Elderly >70 | Lower HGH starting doses |

## Critical Compound Warnings

### LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone) — CRITICAL
- **Blocks opioid receptors completely**
- **Cannot use ANY opioid medications while on LDN**
- Stop 3-5 days before surgery if opioid anesthesia/analgesia needed
- Vivid dreams first 1-2 weeks (resolves)

### HGH
- Target IGF-1: 150-250 ng/mL
- IGF-1 >300: reduce dose
- IGF-1 >400: stop
- Combined with Metformin for insulin resistance

### Rapamycin
- **Immunosuppressive** — monitor for infections
- **Mouth sores** (10-20%)
- **Delays wound healing** — hold 1-2 weeks before surgery
- **CYP3A4 interactions** — avoid grapefruit, azole antifungals, clarithromycin

### Low-Dose Aspirin
- GI bleeding risk — monitor for dark stools
- Hold 7 days before surgery

### Acarbose
- GI effects (flatulence, bloating) very common initially
- **Glucose tablets for hypoglycaemia** (sucrose won't work)
- Stronger effect in males (22%) vs females (5%)

### 17-alpha Estradiol
- **Males only** — no female lifespan benefit
- Non-feminising; requires intact testosterone

### Senolytics (Procyanidin C1 / Fisetin)
- Pulsed dosing only — do not use continuously
- Transient flu-like symptoms possible

## Drug Interactions

| Medication | Interaction |
|------------|-------------|
| **Opioids (ANY)** | **CONTRAINDICATED with LDN** — stop LDN 3-5 days before |
| Anticoagulants | Aspirin increases bleeding risk |
| NSAIDs | Aspirin + NSAIDs = increased GI bleeding — avoid |
| **CYP3A4 Inhibitors** | Increase Rapamycin levels — grapefruit, ketoconazole, erythromycin |
| **CYP3A4 Inducers** | Decrease Rapamycin levels — rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's Wort |
| Insulin / Oral Hypoglycaemics | HGH, Acarbose affect glucose |
| Immunosuppressants | Additive with Rapamycin |
| Metformin + IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h before/after |
| Digestive Enzymes | May reduce Acarbose efficacy |
| **Chemotherapy** | **CONTRAINDICATED** — growth factors + cancer treatment |

---

## Pre-Procedure

| Procedure | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Surgery | Rapamycin: hold 1-2 weeks; LDN: stop 3-5 days; Aspirin: hold 7 days |
| Dental (significant bleeding expected) | Consider stopping Aspirin 3-5 days |
| IV Contrast | Hold Metformin 48h |
| Vaccinations | Rapamycin may reduce efficacy; discuss timing |

## Sex-Specific Notes

### Males
- 17-alpha Estradiol: monitor for feminisation (should not occur)
- PSA monitoring >40 years
- Haematocrit monitoring (HGH + Testosterone elevate)

### Females
- 17-alpha Estradiol: **not indicated** (no benefit)
- Acarbose: weaker lifespan effect (5% vs 22% in males)

## Emergency Signs

Seek emergency care if:
- Anaphylaxis
- Chest pain / shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot
- Severe abdominal pain / black or bloody stools
- Signs of serious infection (especially on Rapamycin)
- Spreading injection site infection
- Opioid withdrawal symptoms (if inadvertently took opioids with LDN)
