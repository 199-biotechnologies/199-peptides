# Prometheus Protocol — Safety Considerations

**Related:** [Prometheus Protocol](prometheus-protocol.md) | [Monitoring & Bloodwork](prometheus-monitoring.md)

---

## Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT use this protocol if:**

| Condition | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Active Cancer or History of Cancer | GH secretagogues and growth factors may stimulate tumour growth |
| Pregnancy or Breastfeeding | Safety not established; potential fetal/infant harm |
| Severe Kidney Disease (eGFR <30) | Impaired peptide clearance; toxicity risk |
| Severe Liver Disease (Child-Pugh C) | Impaired metabolism; unpredictable effects |
| Active Diabetic Retinopathy | GH can worsen retinal neovascularisation |
| Intracranial Hypertension | GH secretagogues may exacerbate |
| Known Hypersensitivity | To any peptide or component in the protocol |
| Age <18 Years | Not studied in paediatric populations |

## Relative Contraindications

**Use with extreme caution / Medical clearance required:**

| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes Mellitus | GH affects glucose; monitor closely, adjust medications |
| Cardiovascular Disease | Monitor BP, heart rate; some peptides may affect cardiac function |
| Autoimmune Conditions | Thymosin Alpha-1 may be beneficial but requires monitoring |
| Thyroid Disorders | GH can affect thyroid axis; monitor TSH, T3, T4 |
| History of Seizures | Some peptides cross BBB; neurological monitoring needed |
| Psychiatric Conditions | Cognitive peptides (Semax, Dihexa) may affect mood/behaviour |
| Bleeding Disorders / Anticoagulant Use | Injection site complications; BPC-157 may affect coagulation |
| Polycystic Conditions (PCOS, PKD) | Growth factors may affect cyst development |
| Recent Surgery (<4 weeks) | Consult surgeon; healing peptides may be beneficial but timing matters |
| Elderly (>70 years) | Start at lower doses; increased sensitivity to GH effects |

## Potential Side Effects & Monitoring Signs

| Category | Possible Effects | Action Required |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Injection Site** | Redness, swelling, bruising, pain, itching | Rotate sites; if persistent >48h, contact provider |
| **GH-Related** | Water retention, joint pain, carpal tunnel, numbness | Reduce dose; if severe, discontinue GH peptides |
| **Metabolic** | Blood sugar changes, increased appetite | Monitor glucose; adjust diet/medications |
| **Cardiovascular** | BP changes, palpitations, oedema | Monitor BP; seek care if chest pain/SOB |
| **Neurological** | Headache, dizziness, mood changes, vivid dreams | Reduce cognitive peptides; persistent = discontinue |
| **Gastrointestinal** | Nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort | Take with/without food as directed; usually transient |
| **Immune** | Flu-like symptoms (esp. Thymosin) | Usually transient; reduce dose if persistent |
| **Allergic** | Rash, hives, difficulty breathing | **STOP immediately**; seek emergency care if severe |

## Potential Drug Interactions

| Medication Class | Interaction Concern | Recommendation |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Insulin / Oral Hypoglycaemics | GH peptides affect glucose metabolism | Monitor closely; may need dose adjustment |
| Anticoagulants (Warfarin, etc.) | BPC-157 may affect coagulation | Monitor INR more frequently |
| Corticosteroids | May counteract peptide effects | Discuss timing and necessity with physician |
| Thyroid Medications | GH affects thyroid axis | Monitor thyroid function; adjust as needed |
| Immunosuppressants | Thymosin peptides modulate immunity | Requires careful immunological monitoring |
| CNS Medications | Semax, Selank, Dihexa affect neurotransmitters | Monitor for altered effects; start peptides low |
| Chemotherapy | **CONTRAINDICATED** — growth factors + cancer treatment | **DO NOT USE** during or shortly after chemo |

---

## Emergency Signs

**Seek emergency care immediately if:**

- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Signs of blood clot (leg swelling, sudden breathlessness)
- Severe abdominal pain
- Spreading injection site infection
- Severe mood changes or confusion
