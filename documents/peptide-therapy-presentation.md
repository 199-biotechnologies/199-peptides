## What is Peptide Therapy?

Peptides are short chains of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins. They act as signalling molecules that tell your body what to do.

As we age, our natural peptide production declines. Peptide therapy replenishes these vital messengers to restore optimal function.

> *"Peptides communicate with cells to trigger specific biological responses — healing, growth, metabolism."*

### Key Benefits

- Accelerated tissue repair
- Enhanced growth hormone
- Improved cognition
- Reduced inflammation
