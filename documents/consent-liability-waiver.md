## 1. Nature of Treatment

I understand that I am voluntarily choosing to participate in a peptide therapy program offered by Dr Ducu Clinics. This program may include, but is not limited to, the administration of various peptides such as BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, Tesamorelin, Ipamorelin/CJC-1295, MOTS-c, Thymosin Alpha-1, Epithalon, Semax, Selank, Dihexa, SS-31, KPV, DSIP, and other related compounds, as well as nutritional supplements.

---

## 2. Regulatory Status of Peptides

**I UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:**

- Many peptides used in this program are classified as **RESEARCH COMPOUNDS** and are **NOT approved** by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), MHRA (UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), EMA (European Medicines Agency), or any other regulatory authority for human therapeutic use
- These compounds have **NOT** undergone the rigorous clinical trial process required for pharmaceutical approval
- The safety, efficacy, and long-term effects of these compounds have **NOT** been fully established through controlled human studies
- I am choosing to use these compounds at my own risk and of my own free will

---

## 3. Known and Unknown Risks

**I understand that peptide therapy carries both KNOWN and UNKNOWN risks:**

### Known Potential Side Effects May Include But Are Not Limited To:

- Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, bruising, infection)
- Water retention and edema
- Joint pain and stiffness
- Carpal tunnel syndrome
- Changes in blood sugar levels
- Blood pressure changes
- Headaches
- Nausea and gastrointestinal discomfort
- Fatigue or changes in energy levels
- Sleep disturbances or vivid dreams
- Mood changes
- Skin changes
- Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis
- Changes in hormone levels
- Effects on tumor growth in those with cancer or pre-cancerous conditions

### Experimental Compounds — Cancer Risk Acknowledgment:

**I UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE** that certain compounds in this protocol (including but not limited to BPC-157, TB-500, MOTS-c, Follistatin, Dihexa) are classified as **experimental interventions with no long-term human safety data regarding cancer risk**. These compounds have growth-promoting or angiogenic properties that theoretically could affect tumor growth. I accept this risk and confirm I have no history of cancer or pre-cancerous conditions.

### Critical Acknowledgment — Unknown Risks:

**I ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT** that many potential side effects, adverse reactions, and long-term consequences of peptide therapy are **CURRENTLY UNKNOWN**. Because these compounds have not undergone comprehensive clinical trials, there may be risks that have not yet been identified or documented. New adverse effects may be discovered in the future. I accept full responsibility for any known OR unknown side effects that may result from this treatment.
