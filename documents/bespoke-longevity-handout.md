# Bespoke Longevity & Age Reversal Protocols

*Skin | Muscles | Hair | Nails | Whole-Body Regeneration*

---

At **Dr DUCU London** we offer fully bespoke longevity and age reversal protocols — advanced, medically supervised programs designed to work from the *inside out* on your skin, muscles, hair, nails and overall biological resilience.

Rather than chasing separate treatments for each concern, these protocols are intended to become your **primary regeneration and anti-ageing strategy**, often reducing the need for multiple stand-alone procedures.

## What Do These Protocols Target?

- **Skin:** Support for collagen, elasticity, firmness and glow
- **Muscles & Strength:** Recovery, tone, performance and body composition
- **Hair:** Follicle support, density and hair-shaft strength
- **Nails:** Keratin support for stronger, less brittle nails
- **Whole-Body Longevity:** Metabolism, energy, immune function, cognition and sleep

---

## How Do They Work?

Your personalised plan is built using carefully selected combinations of:

- **Regenerative compounds** (including peptides where appropriate) to support tissue repair, collagen synthesis and mitochondrial function
- **Longevity-focused nutrients** to assist cellular energy, autophagy and protection from oxidative stress
- **Hormone and metabolic support**, where clinically indicated, to help optimise body composition, vitality and mood
- **Brain, mood and sleep optimisation** to support recovery, focus and emotional resilience

Protocols are usually structured in phases across approximately **16 weeks**, with specific combinations for male and female physiology (including dedicated, female-optimised pathways for skin, bone, hormones and hair).

## What Makes This Different From Standard Aesthetic Treatments?

- **Inside-out approach:** Focus on cellular and hormonal foundations, not just what can be seen on the surface
- **Multi-system, not single-problem:** One integrated protocol can address skin, muscles, hair and nails together
- **Personalised dosing & selection:** Built around your bloodwork, goals and medical history — no "one size fits all"
- **Ongoing monitoring:** Key markers (such as inflammation, metabolic health, hormones and biological age tests where appropriate) are reviewed at intervals to guide adjustments
- For many patients this becomes the **central longevity and regeneration plan**, with other aesthetic procedures used only as minimal, finishing touches if desired

## What Can I Expect?

1. **Comprehensive consultation** — medical history, goals and expectations
2. **Baseline tests** — targeted bloodwork and, if appropriate, biological age assessment
3. **Custom protocol design** — built from our Prometheus (male) and Athena (female) frameworks and tailored to you
4. **16-week active phase** — structured cycles of treatment, lifestyle guidance and review
5. **Re-testing and refinement** — to decide next steps and maintenance

Results vary between individuals. Some people notice changes in energy, sleep and recovery first; visible changes to skin, muscles, hair and nails typically appear gradually over weeks to months.
