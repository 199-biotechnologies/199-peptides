# Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**OCEBM Evidence Level:** 1 (Multiple Phase III RCTs)
**Risk Profile:** LOW-MODERATE (Well-characterized)
**FDA Status:** APPROVED

---

## What Is This?

Tirzepatide is **currently the most effective weight loss drug available** — a "dual agonist" hitting both GIP and GLP-1 receptors (semaglutide only hits GLP-1). Phase III trials showed **20-22% weight loss**, with 57% of participants losing over 20% of their body weight. Head-to-head against semaglutide, tirzepatide won on both weight loss (12.4 kg vs 6.2 kg) and blood sugar control. Brand names: Mounjaro (diabetes), Zepbound (obesity). Same cautions as semaglutide: nausea, cost (~$1,000/month), and weight returns if you stop.

## Clinical Evidence

### SURMOUNT-1: The Obesity Benchmark

SURMOUNT-1 enrolled 2,539 adults without diabetes and followed them for 72 weeks. The results established tirzepatide as the most effective weight loss medication ever approved. At the highest dose (15mg), participants lost an average of 20.9% of their body weight. The response rates were extraordinary: 91% of participants on 15mg lost more than 5% of their body weight, and 57% lost more than 20%.

To contextualise these numbers: a 250-pound person losing 20% of their body weight would lose 50 pounds. Previous obesity medications produced losses in the 5-8% range. Bariatric surgery typically produces 25-30% weight loss. Tirzepatide approaches surgical efficacy through pharmaceutical means.

The dose-response was clear. At 5mg, weight loss averaged 15.0% with 32% of participants achieving >20% loss. At 10mg, these figures rose to 19.5% and 50%. The maximum 15mg dose produced the best results but also the highest side effect burden.

### SURPASS-2: Head-to-Head Against Semaglutide

The SURPASS-2 trial provided the comparison everyone wanted: tirzepatide versus semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide 15mg produced 12.4 kg weight loss compared to 6.2 kg with semaglutide 1mg — a two-fold advantage. On blood sugar control, tirzepatide reduced HbA1c by 2.46% versus 1.86% with semaglutide. The proportion achieving HbA1c below 7% was 92% versus 81%.

The comparison is not entirely fair — semaglutide 1mg is not the maximum dose, and the 2.4mg obesity dose might narrow the gap. But at comparable clinically-used doses, tirzepatide demonstrated clear superiority on both weight and glucose endpoints.

## Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide's enhanced efficacy stems from dual incretin agonism. While semaglutide activates only GLP-1 receptors, tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. Understanding why this matters requires understanding what these hormones do.

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is the familiar target. It reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, enhances insulin secretion, and suppresses glucagon. These effects explain semaglutide's efficacy.

GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) is the less familiar partner. It enhances insulin secretion in response to glucose, but its other effects remain under investigation. What's clear is that adding GIP activation to GLP-1 activation produces better outcomes than GLP-1 alone — the ~20-22% weight loss with tirzepatide exceeds the ~15% with semaglutide.

There's also evidence that dual agonism may improve tolerability. The nausea and vomiting that plague GLP-1 agonists might be partially offset by GIP effects, though this hypothesis requires further validation.

## Dosing

### Standard Titration

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| 1-4 | 2.5mg |
| 5-8 | 5mg |
| 9-12 | 7.5mg |
| 13-16 | 10mg |
| 17-20 | 12.5mg |
| 21+ | 15mg (maximum) |

**Administration:** SC weekly, same day, any time.

**Slow titration is critical** — do not rush to higher doses.

### Slow-Track Titration (GI-Sensitive Patients)

For sensitive patients, hold each step for 8 weeks instead of 4, or stop escalation at 7.5–10 mg if weight loss and HbA1c goals are met. Not everyone needs the maximum dose. Many patients achieve excellent results at 10mg with fewer side effects than 15mg.

## Safety Profile

### Common Side Effects

| Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Nausea | 12-33% | Slow titration helps |
| Diarrhea | 12-23% | Usually transient |
| Constipation | 6-12% | Fiber, hydration |
| Vomiting | 5-12% | Smaller meals |
| Decreased appetite | Expected | Therapeutic effect |

The gastrointestinal side effects follow the same pattern as semaglutide: dose-dependent, usually transient, mitigated by slow titration. The frequency may be slightly lower than semaglutide at equivalent efficacy levels, possibly due to GIP's moderating effect, though direct comparisons are limited.

### Serious Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Pancreatitis | Rare; discontinue if suspected |
| Gallbladder disease | With rapid weight loss |
| Thyroid C-cell tumors | Boxed warning (rodent signal) |
| Hypoglycemia | With insulin/sulfonylureas |
| Gastroparesis worsening | Avoid if severe GI dysmotility |

### Action Thresholds

**Pancreatitis:** Stop immediately and evaluate if persistent severe epigastric pain or lipase/amylase >3× ULN.

**Gallbladder:** Check gallbladder ultrasound in those with right upper quadrant pain or rapid weight loss plus biliary symptoms.

**Heart rate:** If resting heart rate increases >10 bpm over baseline and persists, consider dose reduction. GLP-1 agonists can modestly increase heart rate.

### Contraindications

- Personal/family history of MTC
- MEN2 syndrome
- Severe GI disease
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

| ApoB | Yes | Every 6-12 months | Superior CV risk marker; reflects atherogenic particle count |
| Lp(a) | Baseline only | - | Genetic risk marker; doesn't change with treatment |
| Liver function | Yes | Every 6-12 months | NASH/MAFLD monitoring |
| Kidney function (eGFR) | Yes | Annual | Standard of care |
| Cystatin C (if >50 or muscular) | Yes | Annual | Muscle-mass-independent renal marker |

## Long-Term Considerations

The same considerations that apply to semaglutide apply to tirzepatide. Weight regain is expected if the medication is discontinued. The drug manages obesity rather than curing it, similar to how antihypertensives manage blood pressure. This raises the question of indefinite treatment for many patients.

Cost remains a barrier: ~$1,000+/month without insurance coverage. Supply issues have affected availability due to extraordinary demand.

Cardiovascular outcome trials are ongoing. While semaglutide has proven cardiovascular benefit (SELECT trial), tirzepatide's CV outcome data is still being collected. Given the shared mechanisms and superior metabolic effects, cardiovascular benefit is expected but not yet proven.

## Comparison

| Agent | Mechanism | Weight Loss | FDA Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Tirzepatide** | GIP + GLP-1 | **20-22%** | Approved |
| Semaglutide | GLP-1 | 15-17% | Approved |
| Retatrutide | GIP + GLP-1 + Glucagon | 24%* | Phase III |
| Liraglutide | GLP-1 | 5-8% | Approved |

The future likely holds even more effective options. Retatrutide, currently in Phase III trials, adds glucagon receptor agonism to the dual incretin approach, producing approximately 24% weight loss in Phase II data. The trajectory is clear: each generation of incretin-based medications produces greater efficacy.
