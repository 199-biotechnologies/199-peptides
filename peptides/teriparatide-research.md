# Teriparatide (Forteo/Tymlos)

**Research Compilation Date:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** FDA APPROVED - Extensive Clinical Data
**Risk Profile:** MODERATE (Well-Studied, Specific Risks)

## What Is This?

Teriparatide is **the only osteoporosis drug that actually builds new bone** — everything else (bisphosphonates, denosumab) just slows bone loss. It's a synthetic version of parathyroid hormone that tricks your body into making new bone when given as daily pulses. Clinical trials showed **65% reduction in vertebral fractures** and +9% spine bone density. The catch: daily self-injections, ~$1,500-2,000/month, and a 2-year lifetime limit due to a theoretical cancer risk (osteosarcoma in rat studies at high doses). Reserved for severe osteoporosis or people who've already fractured.

## Overview

Teriparatide is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34), comprising the first 34 amino acids of human PTH. It is FDA-approved for osteoporosis treatment and represents the only anabolic (bone-building) osteoporosis medication, as opposed to anti-resorptive drugs that only prevent bone loss. It stimulates new bone formation and is reserved for high-risk patients due to cost and the requirement for daily injections.

## Mechanism of Action

Teriparatide achieves something unique in osteoporosis treatment: it builds new bone rather than merely preventing loss. The mechanism centres on osteoblast stimulation through PTH1 receptor activation. When teriparatide binds these receptors on bone-forming cells, it triggers a cascade that stimulates new bone formation, increases bone mineral density, and improves bone microarchitecture at the structural level. This isn't preservation; it's reconstruction.

The critical distinction is timing: intermittent versus continuous PTH exposure produces opposite effects. Daily injections create pulsatile exposure, which is anabolic — it builds bone. Continuous elevation, as seen in hyperparathyroidism, is catabolic — it breaks down bone. This pharmacological quirk defines teriparatide's entire therapeutic approach. The daily pulse stimulates osteoblasts without triggering the bone resorption that continuous PTH elevation causes. Dose timing isn't a detail; it's the entire basis for the drug's effect.

Bone remodelling under teriparatide shifts dramatically toward net bone gain. Bone turnover markers increase, reflecting heightened activity, but the net effect is increased bone mass. Trabecular connectivity improves — the internal scaffolding of bone becomes more interconnected and structurally sound. Cortical thickness enhances, strengthening the outer shell. The result is both quantitative (more bone mass) and qualitative (better bone architecture).

Every other osteoporosis drug works by preventing bone loss through various anti-resorptive mechanisms — bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts, denosumab blocks RANK ligand, SERMs modulate estrogen receptors. Teriparatide alone builds new bone. This fundamental mechanistic difference explains both its unique efficacy and its positioning as a therapy for severe osteoporosis when prevention has already failed.

| Drug Class | Mechanism | Effect |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Teriparatide** | Anabolic | **Builds new bone** |
| Bisphosphonates | Anti-resorptive | Prevents bone loss |
| Denosumab | Anti-resorptive | Prevents bone loss |
| SERMs | Anti-resorptive | Prevents bone loss |

## Clinical Evidence

The pivotal trials for teriparatide delivered dramatic fracture reduction data. Vertebral fractures decreased by 65% — a magnitude of benefit that exceeds most osteoporosis interventions. Non-vertebral fractures fell by 53%. Bone mineral density increased 9% at the spine and 3-4% at the hip. These aren't marginal improvements; they represent substantial shifts in fracture risk and bone structure. The combination of fracture prevention and BMD increase created an evidence package strong enough to secure FDA approval in 2002.

Long-term follow-up reveals that effects persist after treatment stops, though transition to anti-resorptive therapy is recommended to maintain gains. Without follow-on treatment, the newly formed bone can be lost through normal remodelling. Bone quality improvements are documented through microarchitectural studies — it's not just more bone, it's better-structured bone. Fracture healing enhancement has been observed, driving off-label use for non-union fractures.

The evidence extends beyond postmenopausal women — the primary indication and largest study population. Men with osteoporosis show similar benefits, earning FDA approval for this indication. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis responds effectively, potentially outperforming bisphosphonates in this population. Off-label use for fracture non-union is supported by case series and mechanistic rationale, though controlled trial data is limited. The evidence base is broad, covering multiple populations where severe bone loss creates fracture risk.

## Dosing Protocol

### Standard FDA-Approved Dosing

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Dose | 20mcg |
| Frequency | Once daily |
| Route | Subcutaneous |
| Duration | Maximum 2 years |
| Site | Thigh or abdomen |

### Administration

- Daily self-injection
- Pen delivery device
- Rotate injection sites
- Any time of day (consistency important)

### Treatment Sequence

**Typical Protocol:**
1. Teriparatide for up to 2 years
2. Transition to anti-resorptive (bisphosphonate or denosumab)

**Why 2-Year Limit:**
- Black box warning for osteosarcoma (rat studies)
- Extended use data limited
- Transition maintains benefits
- **Lifetime exposure to PTH-analog anabolics (teriparatide ± abaloparatide) should not exceed 2 years in total.**

## Special Applications

### Fracture Healing (Off-Label)

Teriparatide's bone-building mechanism extends logically to fracture repair, and case series support this application. Non-union fractures — fractures that fail to heal — show positive responses in published case series, with patients achieving union after teriparatide initiation. Delayed healing may accelerate under treatment, though evidence remains primarily observational. Stress fractures have limited data but mechanistic rationale. The dose matches the standard osteoporosis protocol: 20 mcg subcutaneously daily. This off-label use represents logical extension of mechanism rather than established indication, but the risk-benefit calculus may favour trial in non-healing fractures where other options have failed.

### Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

This indication carries FDA approval based on specific trial data. Glucocorticoid use causes rapid bone loss through suppression of osteoblast function — precisely the pathway teriparatide stimulates. It may be preferred over bisphosphonates in this population, particularly when fracture risk is high and bone formation needs active stimulation rather than mere preservation of existing bone. The anabolic mechanism offers advantages when steroids have already suppressed bone formation significantly.

## Practical Recommendations

### If Prescribed

1. **Learn proper injection technique**
2. **Take calcium and vitamin D:** Essential support
3. **First dose sitting:** Orthostatic hypotension possible
4. **Plan for transition:** After 2 years max
5. **Report symptoms:** Especially hypercalcemia signs

### Signs of Hypercalcemia

Watch for:
- Nausea/vomiting
- Constipation
- Confusion
- Fatigue
- Increased thirst

### Monitoring Rules

- **Check calcium at baseline and at 1 and 3 months;** stop or reduce if persistent hypercalcaemia.
- **Do not re-start beyond 2 years** even if BMD drops; switch to anti-resorptive instead.

### Maximizing Benefit

- Don't miss doses
- Weight-bearing exercise
- Fall prevention
- Adequate nutrition
- Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol

*Teriparatide is FDA-approved for osteoporosis in high-risk patients. It is the primary anabolic bone-forming option available. Treatment is limited to 2 years due to theoretical osteosarcoma risk. Requires daily self-injection and follow-up with anti-resorptive therapy. Cost is significant but patient assistance programs exist.*
