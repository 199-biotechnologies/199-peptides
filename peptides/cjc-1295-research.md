---

## What Is This?

CJC-1295 is a modified version of your body's natural growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). It tells your pituitary gland to release more growth hormone, which can improve body composition, recovery, and sleep. It comes in two forms: one with "DAC" (lasts a week, less natural) and one without DAC (lasts hours, more physiological). Often combined with Ipamorelin for synergistic effects.

## Clinical Evidence

### Phase I/II Human Data

The foundational human study (Teichman et al., 2006) examined single subcutaneous injections of CJC-1295 DAC. The findings were significant: GH levels elevated 2-10 times baseline for 6+ days following a single injection. IGF-1 levels elevated 1.5-3 times baseline for 9-11 days. With multiple doses, IGF-1 remained elevated for up to 28 days. The compound was well-tolerated at 30-60 mcg/kg doses with no serious adverse reactions.

### Development History

CJC-1295 reached Phase II trials for lipodystrophy and GH deficiency. Development was discontinued after one trial subject died — an event attributed to asymptomatic coronary artery disease (plaque rupture) and assessed as unrelated to CJC-1295 treatment. The compound's inherent safety profile was not implicated.

---

## Mechanism of Action

CJC-1295 binds to GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotrophs — the cells that produce and release growth hormone. This binding primes the pituitary for GH release. The compound's four amino acid substitutions prevent degradation by DPP-IV, an enzyme that rapidly breaks down natural GHRH. In the DAC version, the drug affinity complex binds to albumin in the blood, extending the half-life from minutes to days.

The difference between the two versions is physiologically significant. The no-DAC version produces GH pulses that mimic natural pituitary function — bursts of release followed by return to baseline. The DAC version produces sustained elevation — higher convenience but less physiological and potentially more concerning for long-term IGF-1 exposure.

---

## DAC vs No DAC: A Critical Choice

| Factor | No DAC | DAC |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Half-life | 30-60 min | 6-8 days |
| GH Pattern | Pulsatile | Sustained |
| Physiology | More natural | Less natural |
| Stacking | Better synergy | Less synergy |
| Pituitary | Preserved sensitivity | May desensitise |
| Convenience | Daily | Weekly |

The recommendation for most applications is the no-DAC version. The more physiological GH pattern better mimics natural secretion. The synergy with ghrelin mimetics (like ipamorelin) is stronger with pulsatile administration. And the risk of pituitary desensitisation is lower without continuous stimulation.

The DAC version's primary advantage is convenience — once-weekly dosing versus daily. But this convenience comes at the cost of sustained IGF-1 elevation, which carries theoretical cancer risk implications.

---

## IGF-1 and Cancer Risk

The same concern that applies to all GH-elevating compounds applies here: sustained IGF-1 elevation is epidemiologically associated with increased cancer risk. This concern is amplified with the DAC version, which maintains elevated IGF-1 for 9-11 days per dose. With repeated weekly dosing, IGF-1 may remain indefinitely elevated — a pattern less physiological than the pulsatile elevation from the no-DAC version.

**Contraindicated in:**
- Active malignancy
- History of cancer
- Very high baseline IGF-1

## Use Cases by Goal

### Anti-Aging / Longevity (with Ipamorelin Stack)

The combination of CJC-1295 (no DAC) with Ipamorelin exploits receptor synergy. CJC-1295 primes the pituitary through GHRH receptors while Ipamorelin triggers release through ghrelin receptors. Different receptors mean the combined effect exceeds the sum of individual effects.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 100mcg + Ipamorelin 200mcg combined, before bed
**Duration:** 6-12+ months for cumulative benefits
**Timing:** Fasted, 30 min before sleep

### Body Composition / Fat Loss

GH promotes lipolysis while preserving lean mass during caloric deficit. The combination addresses body composition through enhanced GH secretion.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 100-200mcg + Ipamorelin 200-300mcg, split AM fasted + PM
**Duration:** 6+ months
**Timing:** Morning fasted maximises fat burning; evening for sleep

### Recovery / Athletic Performance

Elevated GH accelerates tissue repair and training adaptation. Athletes use the combination to support recovery between training sessions.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 100mcg + Ipamorelin 200mcg, post-workout + before bed
**Duration:** Ongoing during training blocks
**Timing:** Within 30 min of training completion

### Sleep Optimisation

GH release during deep sleep enhances sleep architecture. Bedtime dosing aligns with the natural nocturnal GH peak.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 100mcg + Ipamorelin 200mcg, 30 min before bed
**Duration:** Ongoing

### Injury Support (with BPC-157)

GH supports collagen and connective tissue repair. Combining GH secretagogues with local BPC-157 addresses both systemic and local repair mechanisms.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 100mcg + Ipamorelin 200mcg daily + BPC-157 250mcg 2x daily local
**Duration:** 4-8 weeks

### DAC Version: Convenience Protocol

For those prioritising convenience over physiological patterns, the DAC version offers weekly dosing with sustained GH elevation.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 DAC 1-2mg weekly
**Duration:** Variable
**Timing:** Any time (sustained release)

## Anecdotal Reports (User Experiences)

**Note:** These are unverified reports from online forums and should not be considered medical evidence.

| Use Case | User Reports |
|----------|--------------|
| Anti-aging/sleep | *"I wake up feeling more recovered"*, *"Sleep is deeper"*, *"Skin quality improved after 3-4 months"* |
| Body composition | *"Midsection fat reduction noticeable at month 3"*, *"Body recomposition without changing diet"* |
| Recovery | *"My training days hit harder"*, *"Recovery between sessions drastically improved"* |
| DAC version | *"More convenient but didn't feel as good as no DAC version"*, *"IGF-1 stayed elevated longer—concerned about cancer risk"* |

---

## Timing and Administration

### Critical Rules

The same rules that apply to ipamorelin apply here. Fasted state required — at least 2 hours since the last meal. No carbs or insulin spike near dosing. Before bed is optimal for alignment with the natural nocturnal GH peak. Post-workout is the second-best option for exercise synergy. Wait 30 minutes before eating after injection.

### Best Timing by Goal

| Goal | Timing |
|------|--------|
| Anti-aging | Before bed |
| Fat loss | Morning fasted |
| Recovery | Post-workout + bed |
| Sleep | 30 min before sleep |

---

## User Experience Timeline

| Timeframe | Reported Effects |
|-----------|------------------|
| Week 1-2 | Improved sleep, vivid dreams |
| Week 2-4 | Better workout recovery |
| Month 1-2 | General wellbeing improvement |
| Month 2-3 | Body composition changes beginning |
| Month 3-6 | Fat loss, skin improvements visible |
| Month 6+ | Full cumulative benefits |

**Effects are slow.** Most users report needing 6+ months for visible results.

### Action Rules

**IGF-1 Rule (Z-Score Based):**
- Z-score > 2 (>2 standard deviations above mean): **Reduce dose by 50%**
- Z-score > 3: **Discontinue immediately**
- Target: Age-adjusted upper-normal range

**HbA1c Rule:**
- If HbA1c increases >0.5% from baseline OR exceeds 5.7%: **Initiate Metformin 500mg BID or Berberine**

**Tumour Marker Rule:**
