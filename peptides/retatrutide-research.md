# Retatrutide (Triple Agonist)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**OCEBM Evidence Level:** 2 (Phase II RCT, Phase III ongoing)
**Risk Profile:** MODERATE (Awaiting long-term data)
**FDA Status:** Investigational (Phase III)

## What Is This?

Retatrutide is the most powerful weight-loss drug ever studied — a "triple agonist" hitting GIP + GLP-1 + Glucagon receptors (semaglutide only hits GLP-1, tirzepatide hits two). Phase II results: **24.2% weight loss at 48 weeks**, with some participants losing 31%. The glucagon component adds something the others lack: increased energy expenditure and fat burning (thermogenesis). Still in Phase III trials, expected approval 2026 if successful. **Currently NOT commercially available** — only through clinical trials.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| OCEBM | Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine — rates evidence quality |
| GLP-1 | Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 — reduces appetite (what semaglutide targets) |

| Thermogenesis | Heat production from burning calories |
| TRIUMPH trials | The Phase III trial program for retatrutide |
| Incretin | Gut hormones (GLP-1, GIP) that regulate blood sugar and appetite |

## Clinical Evidence

### Phase II: A New Benchmark

The Phase II trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2023 established retatrutide as the most effective weight loss medication ever tested. The 338-participant study ran for 48 weeks with three dose groups. The results exceeded anything previously seen in obesity pharmacotherapy.

At the highest dose (12mg), participants lost an average of 24.2% of their body weight. To contextualise: this approaches the 25-30% typically seen with bariatric surgery. More striking still, 26% of participants on the 12mg dose lost more than 30% of their body weight — a result previously unachievable through medication alone.

Perhaps most significant was a finding buried in the data: participants had not reached a weight plateau at 48 weeks. Weight was still declining when the trial ended, suggesting that longer treatment might produce even greater reductions.

### 2025 Trial Reports

Early reports from ongoing trials describe some participants losing up to 31% of their body weight within 8 months. These anecdotal accounts from trial participants significantly exceed what approved GLP-1 agonists achieve.

### Why Triple Exceeds Dual

The addition of glucagon receptor agonism to the GIP + GLP-1 combination introduces metabolic effects absent from tirzepatide and semaglutide. While all incretins suppress appetite, only glucagon receptor activation increases energy expenditure and promotes thermogenesis — the body literally burns more calories, even at rest.

| Effect | GLP-1 Only | Dual (GIP+GLP-1) | Triple (+Glucagon) |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Appetite reduction | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Energy expenditure | Minimal | Minimal | **Increased** |
| Fat oxidation | Some | Some | **Enhanced** |
| Thermogenesis | No | No | **Yes** |

The glucagon component essentially adds a calorie-burning dimension to what was previously just calorie-restriction pharmacology.

## Safety Profile

### Phase II Data

| Side Effect | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| Nausea | 15-26% |
| Diarrhea | 16-22% |
| Vomiting | 8-18% |
| Constipation | 10-16% |

The gastrointestinal side effect profile is surprisingly similar to tirzepatide despite the additional mechanism. This suggests that GI effects are driven primarily by GLP-1 receptor activation rather than the glucagon component.

### Concerns Requiring Phase III Clarification

The Phase II trial noted dose-dependent heart rate increases and reports of mild to moderate cardiac arrhythmias. Glucagon has known cardiac effects, making this observation biologically plausible but potentially concerning. No severe hypoglycemia or deaths were reported.

Long-term cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown. Given that semaglutide demonstrated cardiovascular benefit in the SELECT trial, the question for retatrutide is whether the glucagon component adds risk or further benefit.

### Heart Rate Monitoring Rule

Phase II trials showed average heart rate increases of 2-5 bpm. For clinical use, if resting heart rate increases more than 10 bpm from baseline, or if new palpitations or arrhythmias appear, the dose should be maintained or reduced and an ECG obtained. Dose escalation should be withheld until heart rate stabilises.

## Comparison

| Agent | Mechanism | Weight Loss | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Retatrutide** | GIP + GLP-1 + Glucagon | **24%+** | Phase III |
| Tirzepatide | GIP + GLP-1 | 21% | Approved |
| Semaglutide | GLP-1 | 15% | Approved |

Each successive generation of incretin-based medications has produced greater efficacy. Retatrutide represents the current frontier.

## Monitoring (Anticipated for Clinical Use)

| Test | Baseline | Ongoing | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| HbA1c | Yes | Every 3 months | Glycemic control |
| Fasting insulin | Yes | Every 3-6 months | Calculate HOMA-IR; insulin resistance |
| Weight | Yes | Each visit | Primary efficacy endpoint |
| Heart rate / ECG | Yes | Regular | Arrhythmia concern from trials |
| Blood pressure | Yes | Regular | Cardiovascular risk |
| Lipid panel | Yes | Every 6 months | Standard metabolic |
| ApoB | Yes | Every 6-12 months | Superior CV risk marker; reflects atherogenic particle count |
| Lp(a) | Baseline only | - | Genetic risk marker; doesn't change with treatment |
| Liver function | Yes | Every 6-12 months | NASH/MAFLD monitoring |
| Kidney function (eGFR) | Yes | Annual | Standard of care |
| Cystatin C (if >50 or muscular) | Yes | Annual | Muscle-mass-independent renal marker |

**Note:** Final monitoring recommendations will be established when FDA-approved labelling is available.

## Phase III Program (2024-2025)

Eli Lilly has invested over $2 billion in the TRIUMPH Phase III program, reflecting confidence in retatrutide's commercial potential. The trials include TRIUMPH-1 (obesity without diabetes), TRIUMPH-2 (obesity with type 2 diabetes), and additional indication-specific trials. Completion is expected in January 2026.

## Dosing (From Trials)

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| 1-4 | 0.5mg |
| 5-16 | Titration |
| 17+ | 4mg, 8mg, or 12mg maintenance |

**Final approved dosing TBD.**

### GI Tolerability Rule

If moderate or severe nausea or vomiting occurs during titration, hold at the current dose for 4 weeks before attempting to increase. If symptoms persist despite holding, down-titrate to the previous tolerated dose. Pushing through severe GI symptoms is counterproductive and rarely necessary.

## Current Access

Retatrutide is **not commercially available**. Access is limited to clinical trial participation. There are no legitimate research sources — any product sold as retatrutide outside of clinical trials should be assumed to be counterfeit or mislabelled.

For those needing treatment now, tirzepatide and semaglutide are FDA-approved and widely available.

---

## Limitations

1. **Not approved** — Phase III ongoing
2. **Long-term safety unknown** — Awaiting data
3. **Heart rate/arrhythmia concerns** require clarification
4. **No access outside trials** — "Research" sources are illegitimate
5. **Approved alternatives exist** — Tirzepatide, semaglutide available now
