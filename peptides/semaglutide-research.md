## What Is This?

Semaglutide is the blockbuster GLP-1 weight loss drug you've heard about (brand names: Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus). It works by mimicking a gut hormone that tells your brain you're full. Clinical trials show **15% average weight loss** — roughly 35 lbs for a 230 lb person — and the SELECT trial proved it also **reduces heart attacks and strokes by 20%**, making it the first weight loss drug with cardiovascular benefit. Downsides: nausea (especially when starting), cost (~$1,000/month), and weight often returns if you stop.

## Clinical Evidence

### The STEP Trials: Obesity Data

STEP 1 enrolled 1,961 adults without diabetes and followed them for 68 weeks. The results established semaglutide as a transformative obesity treatment. Participants on the 2.4mg dose lost an average of 14.9% of their body weight — approximately 35 pounds for a 230-pound person. By comparison, the placebo group lost just 2.4%. Perhaps more striking: 69% of semaglutide patients lost more than 10% of their body weight, and 54% lost more than 15%. These response rates far exceed any previous obesity medication.

STEP 2 examined patients with both obesity and type 2 diabetes, a population typically more resistant to weight loss. Even here, semaglutide produced 9.6% weight loss versus 3.4% with placebo.

### The SELECT Trial: Cardiovascular Breakthrough

The 2023 SELECT trial changed how we think about obesity medications. For the first time, a weight loss drug demonstrated cardiovascular benefit independent of its effects on blood sugar. Semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events — heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular death — by 20%. This benefit appeared regardless of diabetes status, suggesting the cardiovascular protection stems from mechanisms beyond glucose control.

The implications are significant. Weight loss medications were previously viewed as cosmetic interventions or diabetes adjuncts. SELECT established semaglutide as a cardiovascular drug in its own right.

### NASH/MAFLD Effect

Phase II data demonstrate histological improvement in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis at semaglutide 0.4 mg/day (or equivalent weekly dosing). Liver fat reduction is a realistic secondary benefit in metabolic patients with fatty liver disease — a population that substantially overlaps with those seeking semaglutide for weight loss.

### SUSTAIN Trials: Diabetes Data

The diabetes trials established semaglutide's glucose-lowering efficacy before its obesity applications became prominent. HbA1c reductions of 1.5-1.8% exceeded most competitor medications. Cardiovascular benefit was confirmed in the SUSTAIN-6 trial.

## Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide works by hijacking a natural appetite regulation system. GLP-1 is a hormone released by the gut after eating that signals satiety to the brain. The natural hormone is rapidly degraded — its half-life is measured in minutes. Semaglutide is a modified version designed to resist degradation, extending its half-life to approximately one week.

The result is sustained appetite suppression that natural GLP-1 could never achieve. Users report feeling full earlier, thinking about food less, and losing interest in snacking. The subjective experience is often described as "food noise" quieting — the constant background hum of appetite awareness simply diminishes.

Beyond appetite, GLP-1 receptor activation slows gastric emptying, meaning food stays in the stomach longer, prolonging satiety. It enhances insulin secretion in response to glucose while suppressing glucagon, improving blood sugar control. The cardiovascular benefits likely involve direct effects on blood vessels, inflammation, and cardiac tissue, though the precise mechanisms remain under investigation.

## Dosing

### Wegovy (Obesity) Titration

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| 1-4 | 0.25mg |
| 5-8 | 0.5mg |
| 9-12 | 1.0mg |
| 13-16 | 1.7mg |
| 17+ | 2.4mg (maintenance) |

### Slow-Track Titration (GI-Sensitive Patients)

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| 1-8 | 0.25mg |
| 9-16 | 0.5mg |
| 17-24 | 1.0mg |
| 25-32 | 1.7mg |
| 33+ | 2.4mg |

Remaining at each step for 8 weeks instead of 4 greatly reduces nausea. Not all patients need to reach 2.4mg — weight loss is often adequate at lower doses, and pushing to maximum can cause unnecessary side effects without proportional benefit.

### Ozempic (Diabetes)

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| 1-4 | 0.25mg |
| 5+ | 0.5mg → 1.0mg → 2.0mg (as needed) |

**Administration:** SC, same day each week, any time, rotate sites.

### Oral (Rybelsus)

Doses of 3, 7, and 14mg are available for daily oral administration. The oral form requires taking the pill fasting with only a small amount of water, then waiting 30 minutes before eating or drinking. Bioavailability is lower than injectable, which explains the daily dosing requirement.

## Safety Profile

### Common Side Effects (Dose-Dependent)

| Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Nausea | 20-44% | Usually resolves with slow titration |
| Vomiting | 5-24% | Smaller meals help |
| Diarrhea | 10-30% | Usually transient |
| Constipation | 5-24% | Fiber, fluids |

The gastrointestinal side effects are dose-dependent and typically improve over time. Slow titration is the primary mitigation strategy — rushing to higher doses dramatically increases nausea and vomiting.

### Serious Risks

| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| Pancreatitis | Rare; discontinue if suspected |
| Gallbladder disease | Increased risk with rapid weight loss |
| Thyroid C-cell tumors | Boxed warning (rodent data, human relevance unclear) |
| Diabetic retinopathy worsening | In diabetes patients |
| Hypoglycemia | With insulin/sulfonylureas |

### Action Thresholds

**Pancreatitis:** If persistent severe upper abdominal pain, vomiting, or lipase >3× ULN occurs, stop and evaluate for pancreatitis immediately.

**Gallbladder:** Check gallbladder ultrasound if biliary symptoms occur, particularly after rapid weight loss (>1 kg/week for several weeks). Rapid weight loss increases gallstone risk independent of medication.

### Contraindications

- Personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
- MEN2 syndrome
- Severe GI disease
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

| Weight | Yes | Each visit | Primary efficacy endpoint |
| Blood pressure | Yes | Regular | Cardiovascular risk |
| Lipid panel | Yes | Every 6-12 months | Standard metabolic |
| ApoB | Yes | Every 6-12 months | Superior CV risk marker; reflects atherogenic particle count |
| Lp(a) | Baseline only | - | Genetic risk marker; doesn't change with treatment |
| Kidney function (eGFR) | Yes | Annual | Standard of care |
| Cystatin C (if >50 or muscular) | Yes | Annual | Muscle-mass-independent renal marker |
| Liver enzymes | Yes | Every 6-12 months | NASH/MAFLD monitoring |

## Long-Term Considerations

Weight regain is common if semaglutide is stopped — approximately two-thirds of lost weight returns within one year of discontinuation. This raises the question of indefinite treatment. Semaglutide doesn't cure obesity; it manages it, much like blood pressure medications manage hypertension.

Cost remains a significant barrier: $900-1,300/month without insurance coverage. Supply shortages have been ongoing due to unprecedented demand.

## Comparison

| Agent | Weight Loss | Frequency | Notes |

| Tirzepatide | 20-22% | Weekly | Superior efficacy |
| Liraglutide | 5-8% | Daily | Lower efficacy |
| Retatrutide | 24%* | Weekly | Phase III |
