# NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)

**Research Compilation Date:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** Extensive Preclinical + Early Clinical Data
**Risk Profile:** LOW

---

## What Is This?

NAD+ is a molecule found in every cell of your body that's essential for energy production, DNA repair, and cellular signalling. **It declines by ~50% by middle age**, and this decline is linked to many aspects of aging. NAD+ restoration (through precursors like NMN or NR, or direct IV infusion) is one of the most researched longevity interventions. Human trials show it increases blood NAD+ levels, though clinical benefits beyond biomarker improvement are still being studied.

## Overview

NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme found in every cell, essential for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular signalling. NAD+ levels decline significantly with age (up to 50% by middle age), and this decline is implicated in many age-related diseases. NAD+ restoration through precursors (NMN, NR) or direct supplementation is one of the most researched longevity interventions, with potential benefits for metabolism, cognition, and healthspan.

## NAD+ Forms and Precursors

### Supplementation Options

| Form | Route | Bioavailability | Evidence |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **NMN** (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) | Oral, sublingual, nasal | Moderate | Phase I-II |
| **NR** (Nicotinamide Riboside) | Oral | Good | Phase I-II, most studied |
| **NAD+ direct** | IV, nasal spray | High (IV), variable (nasal) | Limited clinical |
| **Niacin** (Vitamin B3) | Oral | Good | Extensive (for other indications) |
| **NAM** (Nicotinamide) | Oral | Good | Limited for NAD+ |

### Niacin and NAM Dosing (Often Overlooked)

| Form | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Niacin (for NAD+ support) | 250–500mg 1–2×/day | Titrate to tolerance (flushing limit) |
| NAM (nicotinamide) | 250–500mg 1–2×/day | Avoid chronic >1.5–2g/day |

**NAM Caution:** High-dose NAM (>1.5–2g/day long-term) may blunt sirtuin activity via feedback inhibition—not preferred as a primary longevity strategy compared to NMN/NR.

## Mechanism of Action

NAD+ functions through four essential cellular pathways, each critical to aging and disease. Energy metabolism sits at the foundation: the NAD+ ↔ NADH conversion drives glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation — the entire cascade of cellular energy production depends on NAD+ availability. This isn't a minor cofactor role; NAD+ is the electron shuttle that makes ATP synthesis possible. When NAD+ declines, mitochondrial function degrades proportionally.

Sirtuin activation represents the longevity pathway. Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) require NAD+ as their obligate substrate — no NAD+, no sirtuin activity. These enzymes regulate DNA repair, inflammation, metabolism, stress resistance, and the fundamental pathways associated with longevity. The connection between NAD+ decline and aging becomes mechanistically clear: as NAD+ drops, sirtuin activity falls, and the protective functions they govern deteriorate.

PARP enzymes consume NAD+ to repair DNA damage. Adequate NAD+ enables efficient repair; depleted NAD+ creates genomic instability. Under oxidative stress or DNA damage, PARPs can deplete NAD+ rapidly, creating an energy crisis in the cell. This DNA repair function competes with energy metabolism and sirtuins for the available NAD+ pool, creating trade-offs when supply is limited.

The CD38 problem accelerates with age. This enzyme, which increases substantially in aging tissues, consumes NAD+ at high rates, contributing significantly to age-related decline. It's become a target for longevity research — inhibit CD38, preserve more NAD+. The decline itself is dramatic and progressive:

| Age | Approximate NAD+ Level |
|-----|----------------------|
| 20s | 100% (baseline) |
| 40s | ~60-70% |
| 60s | ~50% |
| 80s | ~25-40% |

This timeline correlates precisely with reduced mitochondrial function, impaired DNA repair, increased inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. The NAD+ decline isn't just associated with aging — it appears mechanistically central to it.

## Clinical Evidence

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) carries the strongest human data — multiple controlled trials demonstrating that oral supplementation reliably increases blood NAD+ levels. Martens et al. (2018) showed 60% increases in blood NAD+ with NR supplementation. Dollerup et al. (2018) confirmed good tolerability and NAD+ elevation. Elhassan et al. (2019) demonstrated the critical finding: increased NAD+ in skeletal muscle, not just blood. This tissue-level penetration matters — blood biomarkers are encouraging, but muscle NAD+ increases suggest functional delivery to metabolically active tissue.

NMN data is emerging rapidly, with recent trials moving beyond biomarkers toward clinical outcomes. Yoshino et al. (2021) demonstrated improved muscle insulin sensitivity in prediabetic women — a functional metabolic improvement, not just a biomarker shift. Igarashi et al. (2022) showed improved sleep and reduced fatigue in elderly subjects. Multiple Phase II trials are currently in progress, positioning NMN on a trajectory toward stronger clinical validation. The evidence base is maturing from "it increases NAD+" to "it improves measurable health outcomes."

Animal studies provide the mechanistic foundation and proof-of-concept data that drove human research. Lifespan extension in mice and worms established NAD+ restoration as a longevity intervention. Metabolic improvements in diabetes models, cognitive protection in Alzheimer's models, exercise performance enhancement, and cardiovascular protection across multiple models created a comprehensive preclinical profile. This animal data is extensive and consistent — NAD+ restoration produces broad beneficial effects across aging-related pathways. The question isn't whether NAD+ restoration helps in animal models; it's how much of that benefit translates to humans.

## Supporting Natural NAD+ Production

Lifestyle interventions provide NAD+ support without supplementation, though effects are generally modest compared to direct precursor administration. Exercise increases NAD+ levels through multiple pathways, including AMPK activation and mitochondrial biogenesis stimulation. Fasting and caloric restriction activate NAD+-dependent pathways, with some evidence suggesting NAD+ levels rise during energy deficit states. Sleep supports NAD+ metabolism through circadian regulation, though the effects are primarily protective rather than elevating. Avoiding alcohol preserves NAD+ by reducing the metabolic burden on NAD+-dependent detoxification pathways. Heat and cold exposure may increase NAD+ through stress response activation, though evidence remains preliminary.

Dietary sources provide precursors but limited direct NAD+. Niacin-rich foods like chicken, tuna, and turkey supply vitamin B3 that can be converted to NAD+. Tryptophan-containing foods provide the amino acid precursor for the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway. Direct NAD+ in food is minimal and likely degraded during digestion. Diet matters for baseline NAD+ status but isn't sufficient to reverse age-related decline.

CD38 inhibition represents an emerging strategy to preserve NAD+ by reducing consumption rather than increasing synthesis. Compounds like apigenin, quercetin, and luteolin show CD38 inhibitory activity in vitro, potentially slowing NAD+ degradation. This approach remains under research — mechanistic rationale is sound, but clinical validation of CD38 inhibitors for NAD+ preservation is absent. The strategy of reducing consumption while increasing synthesis (via precursors) offers theoretical synergy.

2. **Start conservative:** 250-500mg
3. **Morning dosing:** May affect sleep if evening
4. **Lifestyle matters:** Exercise, sleep, diet still essential
5. **Realistic expectations:** Effects may be subtle
6. **Quality matters:** Third-party tested products

### Choosing a Form

*NAD+ and its precursors represent one of the most promising longevity interventions. While clinical evidence is still emerging, the biological rationale is strong and safety profile is good. Oral precursors (NMN, NR) are the most practical approach. NAD+ IV is popular but evidence is limited. Combining supplementation with lifestyle factors that support NAD+ may be optimal.*
