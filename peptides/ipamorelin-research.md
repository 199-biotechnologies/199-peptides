# Ipamorelin (Selective Growth Hormone Secretagogue)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**OCEBM Evidence Level:** 4 (Phase I/II human data)
**Risk Profile:** LOW-MODERATE (Indirect IGF-1 elevation)

---

## What Is This?

Ipamorelin is the "cleanest" growth hormone-releasing peptide available. It triggers your pituitary to release GH without the side effects of older GHRPs — minimal cortisol increase, minimal prolactin, and minimal appetite spike. In clinical trials, it boosted GH ~300% above baseline. Often combined with CJC-1295 (no DAC) for synergistic effects, it's popular for anti-aging, fat loss, sleep improvement, and recovery. Effects are slow but cumulative — most users need 6+ months to see visible results.

## Clinical Evidence

### The Selectivity Advantage

Ipamorelin's defining characteristic is its selectivity. A 1998 study demonstrated that even at 200 times the ED50 for GH release, ipamorelin did not elevate ACTH or cortisol — selectivity comparable to GHRH itself, the body's natural GH-releasing hormone. This hormonal cleanliness distinguishes ipamorelin from older growth hormone secretagogues.

A 2012 double-blind study in healthy adults administered 100mcg daily subcutaneously. Growth hormone increased approximately 300% above baseline. Critically, there was no significant change in cortisol or prolactin — the hormones that cause many of the side effects associated with other GHRPs.

### Human Trial Data

A 2015 randomised trial in postmenopausal women examined six months of ipamorelin therapy. The results showed improved lean body mass and improved bone mineral density — outcomes consistent with restored GH signalling.

## Why Ipamorelin Is Unique

The comparison with other growth hormone secretagogues reveals ipamorelin's advantages:

| Secretagogue | GH Release | Cortisol | Prolactin | Appetite |
|--------------|------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Ipamorelin** | Strong | **Minimal** | **Minimal** | **Minimal** |
| GHRP-2 | Strong | Some | Some | Strong |
| GHRP-6 | Strong | Some | Some | Very Strong |
| MK-677 | Sustained | Some | Minimal | Strong |

The clinical significance is substantial. Minimal cortisol effect means less catabolic interference — cortisol breaks down muscle and suppresses immune function. Minimal prolactin elevation means lower gynecomastia risk than GHRP-2/6. Minimal appetite spike means easier fat loss — users aren't fighting increased hunger. This is the cleanest hormonal profile in the class, though "minimal" is not "none."

---

## Mechanism of Action

Ipamorelin activates the GHS-R1a receptor — the same receptor that ghrelin, the body's hunger hormone, uses. However, unlike ghrelin, ipamorelin produces highly selective GH release without the broader hormonal cascade that ghrelin triggers. The pituitary responds by releasing growth hormone in a pulse, mimicking the body's natural pulsatile GH secretion pattern.

This pulsatile release is physiologically important. The body releases GH in bursts, particularly during deep sleep, not as a continuous drip. By triggering discrete pulses rather than sustained elevation, ipamorelin respects this natural rhythm — unlike some other approaches to GH enhancement.

---

## Use Cases by Goal

### Anti-Aging / Longevity

Growth hormone naturally declines approximately 14% per decade after age 30. This decline correlates with decreased skin elasticity, loss of lean mass, increased visceral fat, and slower recovery. Restoring pulsatile GH secretion may counteract these changes.

**Protocol:** 200mcg before bed, daily, 6-12+ months
**Timing:** Aligns with natural nocturnal GH peak

### Recovery / Athletic Performance

Growth hormone accelerates tissue repair, collagen synthesis, and recovery from training stress. Athletes use ipamorelin to support adaptation to training loads.

**Protocol:** 200-300mcg post-workout + 200mcg before bed
**Timing:** Post-workout captures exercise-induced synergy; bedtime for sleep optimisation

### Body Composition (Fat Loss + Muscle Preservation)

Growth hormone promotes lipolysis while preserving lean tissue during caloric deficit. This makes it particularly valuable during cutting phases where the goal is fat loss without muscle sacrifice.

**Protocol:** 300mcg daily, ideally split AM/PM during fasting windows
**Timing:** Fasted state maximises GH response (insulin antagonises GH)

### Sleep Quality Enhancement

Growth hormone is released primarily during deep sleep. Enhancing GH secretion at bedtime may deepen sleep architecture, and users consistently report improved sleep quality.

**Protocol:** 200-300mcg 30 min before bed
**Timing:** Consistent bedtime dosing

### Injury Rehabilitation

Growth hormone supports tendon, ligament, and cartilage repair. For injury recovery, ipamorelin provides systemic GH support while local interventions (like BPC-157) address the injury site directly.

**Protocol:** 300mcg 2x daily (morning + evening) for 4-8 weeks
**Often stacked with:** BPC-157 (synergistic tissue healing)

---

## Timing and Administration

### Critical Rules

The rules for ipamorelin administration are non-negotiable if you want optimal results. A fasted state is required — at least 2 hours since the last meal, especially carbohydrates. Insulin antagonises GH release, so any carb/sugar intake near dosing will blunt the response. After injection, wait 30 minutes before eating.

Consistency matters. The same time daily produces the best results. Most users prefer bedtime dosing for convenience and physiological alignment with the natural nocturnal GH peak.

### Optimal Timing by Goal

| Goal | Best Time | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Sleep/Recovery | Before bed | Aligns with nocturnal GH peak |
| Fat loss | Morning fasted | Maximises lipolysis |
| Athletic | Post-workout | Synergy with exercise-induced GH |
| General wellness | Before bed | Most convenient, physiological |

## User Experience Timeline

| Timeframe | Reported Effects |
|-----------|------------------|
| Week 1-2 | Improved sleep quality, vivid dreams |
| Week 2-4 | Better workout recovery |
| Month 1-2 | General wellbeing improvement |
| Month 2-3 | Body composition changes beginning |
| Month 3-6 | Fat loss, skin improvements visible |
| Month 6+ | Full cumulative benefits; hair, nails, energy |

**Critical understanding:** Effects are slow and cumulative. Most users report needing 6+ months for full benefits. Short cycles (4-8 weeks) typically show limited results. This is not a quick-fix compound.

## Stacking Options

### With CJC-1295 (no DAC) — Most Common

This combination exploits receptor synergy. CJC-1295 (no DAC) activates GHRH receptors, priming the pituitary for GH release. Ipamorelin then triggers the release pulse through GHS-R1a (ghrelin receptor). Different receptors mean amplified response greater than the sum of parts.

**Protocol:** CJC-1295 (no DAC) 100mcg + Ipamorelin 200mcg combined in same injection, before bed

### With BPC-157 (Injury Protocol)

Ipamorelin provides systemic GH support while BPC-157 addresses local injury via the NO system. Different mechanisms produce additive healing effects.

### With Tesamorelin (TITAN Protocol)

Sequential use — Tesamorelin Phase 1, then Ipamorelin + CJC Phase 2 — avoids tolerance and maximises benefit.

- Target: Age-adjusted upper-normal range
- Consider 1-2 month "drug holidays" every 6-12 months regardless of IGF-1 levels

**HbA1c Rule:**
- If HbA1c increases >0.5% from baseline OR exceeds 5.7%: **Initiate Metformin 500mg BID or Berberine**

**Tumour Marker Rule:**
- Any elevation in PSA, CEA, or CA-125: **Immediate cessation of ALL growth factors** (GH peptides, BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, Dihexa)

## IGF-1 and Cancer Risk

Ipamorelin elevates GH, which increases IGF-1. Elevated IGF-1 is epidemiologically associated with increased cancer risk — particularly colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.

Important distinctions apply. Ipamorelin creates pulsatile GH, which is more physiological than sustained elevation. It doesn't directly raise IGF-1 to supraphysiological levels. The effect depends on individual pituitary reserve.

No direct evidence links ipamorelin to cancer. However, the GH/IGF-1 pathway is associated with cancer risk, and long-term studies are lacking. Prudence dictates caution.

**Contraindicated in:**
- Active malignancy
- History of cancer (relative)
- Very high baseline IGF-1

---

## Contraindications

- Active malignancy
- History of cancer (relative)
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Pituitary tumours
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

---

## Limitations

1. **Not FDA approved** — Research compound only
2. **GH/IGF-1 cancer concern** — Long-term risk unknown
3. **Effects require 6+ months** — Not for those wanting quick results
4. **Limited by pituitary reserve** — Won't work if pituitary exhausted
5. **Cost over time** — Long-term commitment required
