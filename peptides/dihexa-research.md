# Dihexa (N-hexanoic-Tyr-Ile-(6)-aminohexanoic amide)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** OCEBM Level 5 (Animal studies only)
**Risk Profile:** HIGH (HGF/c-Met oncogenic pathway, zero human data)

---

## What Is This?

Dihexa is a research compound that dramatically enhances brain connectivity in animal studies — claimed to be 10 million times more potent than BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) at promoting synapse formation. However, it works through the HGF/c-Met pathway, which is **the same pathway many cancers use to grow and spread**. There are ZERO human trials, and a related compound recently failed Phase 3 trials for Alzheimer's.

## Mechanism of Action

Dihexa's cognitive effects stem from its modulation of the HGF/c-Met pathway, one of the most powerful growth signalling systems in the body. The compound binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with high affinity and allosterically potentiates its interaction with the c-Met receptor. This prolonged receptor activation cascades into the PI3K/Akt pathway, promoting neuronal survival, and enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory.

The synaptogenic potency is remarkable. In laboratory assays, Dihexa promotes synapse formation at concentrations 10 million times lower than BDNF, the brain's native growth factor. This isn't a modest improvement — it represents a fundamentally different potency class.

The effects extend to structural changes in the brain. Studies show 3-fold increases in dendritic spine density in the hippocampus — the brain region critical for memory formation. These aren't transient functional changes; they represent actual rewiring of neural circuits.

But mechanism is a double-edged sword. The HGF/c-Met pathway that enables this neural plasticity is the same pathway that cancers exploit for proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. Dihexa doesn't just incidentally affect this pathway — it directly and potently activates it.

### Synaptogenic Potency Comparison

| Compound | Relative Potency |
|----------|------------------|
| BDNF | 1x |
| Angiotensin IV | ~100x |
| Nle1-Ang IV | ~10,000x |
| Dihexa | ~10,000,000x |

## Oncogenesis Risk Assessment

### The HGF/c-Met Pathway Is an Established Oncogenic Driver

This is not theoretical concern or speculation. c-Met overexpression is documented in lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma. The pathway promotes tumour cell proliferation, angiogenesis (tumour blood supply), metastasis, tissue invasion, and treatment resistance.

The pharmaceutical industry has spent billions developing c-Met inhibitors precisely because this pathway drives cancer progression. Dihexa does the opposite — it activates c-Met.

### No Long-Term Safety Data Exists

No studies — animal or human — have tested long-term Dihexa exposure for tumorigenesis, cancer progression, or effects on pre-existing malignancies. This isn't a gap in the literature; it's a chasm. Users of Dihexa are engaging in uncontrolled human experimentation with a compound that directly activates a known oncogenic pathway.

### Related Compound Failure: Fosgonimeton (ATH-1017)

In September 2024, Athira Pharma announced that fosgonimeton, an HGF/c-Met modulator developed for Alzheimer's disease, failed to meet primary endpoints in its Phase 3 trial of 312 patients. There was no significant improvement over placebo.

This failure raises fundamental questions about whether HGF/c-Met modulation translates from animal models to human cognitive benefit. The pathway clearly matters in rodents. Whether it matters in human cognition remains unproven.

### Patent Claims Are Insufficient Reassurance

The patent states: "Short duration safety studies with dihexa have uncovered no apparent toxicity. Of particular note is a lack of neoplastic induction..."

Short-term absence of tumours means little. Oncogenesis typically requires prolonged exposure. A compound that activates c-Met for weeks or months might not produce visible tumours during a short study but could initiate processes that manifest years later.

## Clinical Evidence

### Preclinical Only — No Human Data

The evidence for Dihexa's cognitive benefits comes entirely from animal studies. In aged rats, it improved spatial memory. In pharmacologically impaired models, it restored cognition to near-normal levels. Dendritic spine density increased 3-fold in the hippocampus. In Alzheimer's disease rat models, Dihexa outperformed donepezil (a standard AD medication).

Perhaps most intriguingly, effects persisted after the drug was stopped — the structural changes to neural circuits apparently outlast the compound itself.

### Key Limitation

Effects were primarily observed in cognitively impaired animals, not healthy controls. Whether Dihexa enhances normal cognition or merely rescues deficits remains unclear.

### Data Integrity Concerns

Several early Dihexa studies have faced questions about data integrity. This is a significant red flag that compounds the already-problematic evidence base.

## Anecdotal Reports (User Experiences)

**Note:** These are unverified reports from online forums and should not be considered medical evidence.

**Commonly Reported:**
- Enhanced verbal fluency
- Improved pattern recognition
- Increased dream vividness
- Enhanced spatial reasoning
- Social/creative enhancement

**Negative Reports:**
- Headaches (dose-dependent)
- Overstimulation/anxiety
- Tolerance development
- Inconsistent product quality

## Dosing (From User Reports)

| Phase | Dose | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| Start | 5-10mg oral | 1 week |
| Maintenance | 10-20mg oral | 4-8 weeks |
| Cycling | 4-6 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off | |

**No medically established safe dose exists.**

If used despite the risks, the most conservative approach involves very short exploratory blocks (≤4 weeks) with long off-periods. Repeated long cycles accumulate exposure to a compound with unknown oncogenic potential.

## Contraindications (Absolute)

- Any cancer history (c-Met pathway involvement)
- Family history of c-Met-associated cancers (lung, gastric, liver, kidney, breast, colorectal)
- Pre-malignant conditions
- Age <25 (brain development concerns)
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding

## Monitoring Protocol (If Using)

| Test | Baseline | Ongoing | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Comprehensive metabolic panel | Yes | Every 3 months | Liver/kidney function |
| CBC | Yes | Every 3 months | Blood dyscrasia screening |
| PSA (men >40) | Yes | Every 3-6 months | Prostate surveillance (c-Met pathway) |
| CEA | Yes | Every 3-6 months | Colorectal marker |
| CA-125 (women) | Yes | Every 3-6 months | Ovarian surveillance |
| AFP (if hepatic risk) | Yes | Every 6 months | Hepatocellular marker (HGF pathway) |
| Annual physical | Yes | Continue | General surveillance |
| Age-appropriate cancer screening | Yes | Per guidelines | c-Met pathway concern |

**Document cognitive baseline and track changes objectively.**

### Tumour Marker Cessation Rule

**Any elevation in PSA, CEA, CA-125, or AFP:** Immediate cessation of Dihexa AND ALL growth factors (GH peptides, BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu)

More frequent monitoring (every 3-6 months instead of 6 months) is warranted due to direct oncogenic pathway activation.

## Alternatives with Better Evidence

The cognitive enhancement landscape includes compounds with actual human safety data:

| Compound | Evidence Level | Safety Profile |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Semax | Russian approval, clinical use | Established |
| Lion's Mane | Human trials | GRAS |
| Creatine | Extensive RCTs | Excellent |
| Bacopa monnieri | Meta-analyses | Good |
| Alpha-GPC | Human trials | Good |

These alternatives may offer smaller cognitive effects, but they come with known safety profiles rather than unknown oncogenic risk.

## Limitations

1. **ZERO human trials** — All evidence extrapolated from animals
2. **Oncogenic pathway modulation** — c-Met is a known oncogene
3. **Long-term safety completely unknown**
4. **Related compound (fosgonimeton) failed Phase 3**
5. **Data integrity concerns** with some original studies
6. **Essentially human experimentation** with unknown consequences
