# SS-31 (Elamipretide / Bendavia)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**OCEBM Evidence Level:** 1-2 (FDA Approved for Barth Syndrome, September 2025)
**Risk Profile:** LOW-MODERATE
**FDA Status:** APPROVED (Barth Syndrome, 2025)

## What Is This?

SS-31 is the **first FDA-approved drug targeting mitochondria directly** (September 2025, for Barth Syndrome). It concentrates inside mitochondria at 1000-5000x higher levels than the rest of the cell and stabilizes cardiolipin — a critical fat molecule in the mitochondrial membrane. The result: more efficient energy production and less oxidative damage. **Key insight:** SS-31 rescues *damaged* mitochondria but does little for healthy ones. Best candidates: those with documented mitochondrial dysfunction, age-related energy decline, or post-cardiac events — not young healthy individuals looking for a boost.

## Why SS-31 is Unique

**First FDA-approved drug targeting mitochondrial dysfunction directly.**

| Property | SS-31 |
|----------|-------|
| Mitochondrial concentration | 1000-5000x vs cytoplasm |
| Target | Cardiolipin (structural) |
| Mechanism | Cristae stabilization, ETC optimization |
| Result | Reduced ROS, increased ATP |

**Critical Insight:** Works best in DAMAGED mitochondria. Healthy mitochondria show less response—this is rescue therapy, not enhancement.

## Clinical Evidence

The TAZPOWER Phase 3 trial delivered the data that changed SS-31 from research compound to FDA-approved drug. In patients with Barth Syndrome — a rare genetic cardiomyopathy caused by cardiolipin dysfunction — elamipretide produced statistically significant improvement on the 6-minute walk test. This wasn't marginal: the effect was robust enough to secure FDA approval in September 2025, making SS-31 the first drug targeting mitochondrial dysfunction directly to reach market.

But the broader trial picture is more complex. Across 18 total trials, results vary by condition. The Barth success stands out precisely because it targeted a cardiolipin disorder — SS-31's direct molecular target. Primary mitochondrial myopathy trials were negative, suggesting that not all mitochondrial dysfunction responds uniformly. Heart failure trials showed mixed results, with positive signals but inconsistent benefit across populations. Skeletal muscle aging studies revealed encouraging signals, consistent with the biological rationale for age-related mitochondrial decline.

Long-term safety data from the 168-week extension studies is reassuring: patients tolerated SS-31 well over three-plus years with no cumulative toxicity and a consistent safety profile. This extended exposure data matters for a novel mechanism drug, demonstrating that chronic mitochondrial targeting doesn't produce unexpected complications over multi-year timeframes.

## Use Cases by Goal

### Mitochondrial Dysfunction / Disease

SS-31's most validated application targets documented mitochondrial disease, particularly cardiolipin-related disorders. The rationale is direct: if your mitochondrial dysfunction stems from cardiolipin instability, SS-31 addresses the root structural problem. Protocols typically use 5mg subcutaneously, either daily or three times weekly for ongoing treatment. This population — those with genetic ETC defects or confirmed mitochondrial disease — represents the strongest responders. User reports describe fundamental shifts: "Energy levels finally improving after years of fatigue." This isn't enhancement; it's restoration of baseline function in damaged systems.

### Age-Related Mitochondrial Decline

As mitochondrial function declines ~50% by middle age, SS-31 offers a targeted intervention to restore ATP synthesis in aged muscle. The empirical protocol favours 5mg three times weekly for 8-12 weeks, often continued long-term. Timing doesn't appear critical, though consistency matters. Older adults with fatigue and reduced stamina report noticeable endurance improvements within two weeks, with recovery from workouts significantly improved. The effects aren't dramatic — this matches the rescue-not-enhancement profile — but they're meaningful for those experiencing genuine age-related decline.

### Chronic Fatigue (Mitochondrial Origin)

A subset of chronic fatigue stems from mitochondrial dysfunction, identifiable through markers like elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios. For these patients, SS-31 may address the underlying energy deficit. Protocols often start with 5mg daily for 2-4 weeks to establish response, then reduce to three-times-weekly maintenance. An 8-12 week trial provides adequate time to assess benefit. User reports emphasize mental clarity — "reduced brain fog" — and improved stamina during prolonged activities, suggesting genuine metabolic improvement rather than stimulant-like effects.

### Post-Cardiac Event Recovery

Preclinical data on ischemia-reperfusion protection is strong, though Phase 2 trials showed mixed results. The rationale remains compelling: mitochondrial protection during the critical recovery phase following cardiac events. Protocols typically use 5mg daily during acute and recovery phases, continuing 4-8 weeks post-event. Evidence level sits between promising preclinical work and inconclusive clinical validation — enough to justify consideration in high-risk scenarios, insufficient to declare established benefit.

### Mitochondrial Stack (with MOTS-c)

Pairing SS-31 with MOTS-c creates a comprehensive mitochondrial strategy: structural cardiolipin support from SS-31, metabolic signalling from MOTS-c. The protocol combines SS-31 5mg three times weekly with MOTS-c 10mg on the same schedule. User experience describes this as "complete mitochondrial support," targeting different aspects of the same organellar system. The synergy is logical — structure plus signalling — though formal validation of the combination is absent.

## Who Responds Well vs. Poorly

| Profile | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Mitochondrial disease | **Strong response** |
| Age-related decline | Good response |
| Chronic fatigue (mito origin) | Good response |
| Post-cardiac event | Good response |
| **Young, healthy** | **Minimal benefit** |
| **Already optimal mito function** | **"Didn't notice much"** |

**Interpretation:** SS-31 rescues dysfunction, doesn't enhance optimal function.

## Synergies

SS-31's structural mechanism creates logical pairing opportunities with compounds targeting different aspects of mitochondrial function. MOTS-c addresses metabolic signalling while SS-31 handles cardiolipin stabilisation — complementary rather than redundant mechanisms. NAD+ precursors like NMN provide the fuel (NADH for the electron transport chain) while SS-31 optimises the machinery's efficiency — substrate meets structure. CoQ10 directly supports electron transport chain function, creating a synergy at the level SS-31 is already optimising. PQQ stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, potentially increasing the number of organelles that SS-31 can then stabilise. Creatine provides ATP buffering capacity, complementing SS-31's effect on ATP synthesis by improving energy availability and utilisation kinetics. Each combination addresses distinct but related pathways in the mitochondrial energy system.

### Response and Safety Rules

- **Response evaluation:** If no subjective or functional improvement after 12 weeks at 5 mg 3×/week, stop or re-evaluate; responders usually notice something by week 4–8.
- **Cancer history:** In any patient with current or past cancer, keep to time-limited 8–12 week trials and avoid indefinite use.
