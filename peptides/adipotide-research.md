# Adipotide (FTPP)

**Research Compilation Date:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** Phase I Human Data + Preclinical
**Risk Profile:** HIGH (Significant Safety Concerns)

---

## What Is This?

Adipotide is an experimental fat-loss peptide that works by destroying the blood vessels that feed fat tissue, causing fat cells to die permanently. Unlike diet or GLP-1 drugs that shrink fat cells, Adipotide eliminates them entirely. However, **human trials revealed serious kidney toxicity**, which halted its development. Much safer alternatives now exist.

## Overview

Adipotide (also known as FTPP - Prohibitin-Targeted Peptide 1) is an experimental peptidomimetic designed to induce targeted fat loss by destroying the blood vessels supplying adipose tissue. Developed at MD Anderson Cancer Center, it showed robust effects in obese primates; limited and unpublished human Phase I data exist. **Safety, not efficacy, stopped development.** It represents a fundamentally different approach—destroying fat cells rather than shrinking them.

## Mechanism of Action

Adipotide operates through a fundamentally different mechanism than any approved fat-loss intervention. Rather than shrinking fat cells or reducing appetite, it destroys them permanently by targeting their blood supply.

The peptide contains two functional domains working in sequence. First, a targeting sequence recognizes and binds to prohibitin, a protein selectively expressed on blood vessels that feed adipose tissue. This homing mechanism allows Adipotide to concentrate specifically at fat tissue vasculature rather than dispersing throughout the body.

Once bound to prohibitin-bearing vessels, the second domain triggers its effect: a proapoptotic payload that induces programmed cell death in the targeted endothelial cells. As these blood vessel cells die, the vessels collapse. Without blood supply, the fat tissue undergoes ischaemic death — the same process that occurs during a heart attack, but deliberately targeted to adipose depots.

The dead fat cells are then absorbed by the body's cleanup systems. Unlike diet-induced fat loss where adipocytes shrink but remain viable (and thus able to refill), Adipotide-induced cell death is permanent. The destroyed fat cells do not regenerate.

### Key Difference from Other Fat Loss

| Approach | Mechanism | Fat Cells After |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Diet/Exercise | Shrinks fat cells | Remain (can refill) |
| GLP-1 agonists | Reduces appetite | Shrink (remain) |
| Liposuction | Physical removal | Gone (from area) |
| **Adipotide** | Destroys blood supply | Die and absorbed |

## Research Evidence

### The Primate Promise

The most compelling data for Adipotide comes from rhesus monkey studies conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Over four weeks of treatment, obese primates lost 11% of body weight and 27% of abdominal fat without any dietary intervention or exercise program. The fat loss was selective — muscle mass remained unchanged. Perhaps most remarkably, the effects persisted after treatment cessation, suggesting the destroyed fat cells did not regenerate.

These results were exceptional by any standard. The magnitude and selectivity of fat loss exceeded what diet or approved medications achieve. The permanence of effect distinguished it from reversible interventions. For a compound targeting obesity, the primate data suggested genuine breakthrough potential.

### The Human Reality

Phase I human trials told a different story. While participants did lose weight, the trial revealed serious safety concerns that would ultimately halt development. Kidney toxicity emerged as the dose-limiting factor — elevated creatinine, proteinuria, and signs of renal stress appeared in multiple subjects. Severe dehydration compounded these issues, likely resulting from fluid shifts as adipose tissue died and was absorbed.

The trial was completed, but the results were never formally published in peer-reviewed literature — itself a signal that the data did not support continued development. No Phase II trials followed. The safety profile, not lack of efficacy, ended Adipotide's clinical trajectory.

### Development Status

Adipotide development appears permanently stalled. No active clinical trials are registered. Arrowhead Research, the company that licensed the technology, has moved on to other therapeutic areas. The compound represents a cautionary tale: dramatic mechanism and preclinical efficacy do not guarantee safety in humans, and cosmetic applications demand exceptionally high safety thresholds that Adipotide could not meet.

## Dosing (Research Context Only)

### Historical Research Doses (NOT Recommended Protocol)

| Protocol | Dose | Frequency | Duration |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|
| Low | 0.1mg/kg | Daily | Variable |
| Standard | 0.3-0.5mg/kg | Daily | 2-4 weeks |

**No validated safe or effective human dosing regimen exists. Any use would require trial-level monitoring.**

### Administration

- Subcutaneous injection
- Daily dosing in studies
- Short cycles due to safety concerns

### Required Monitoring (If Administered in Trial Setting)

| Test | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Creatinine, eGFR, urea, electrolytes | Baseline + at least twice weekly |
| Weight, blood pressure | Daily |
| Strict hydration protocol | Continuous |
| **Immediate cessation** | On any rise in creatinine or drop in eGFR |

## Safety Profile

### CRITICAL SAFETY CONCERNS

| Risk | Severity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Kidney toxicity** | HIGH | Observed in human trial |
| **Dehydration** | HIGH | Significant fluid loss |
| Electrolyte imbalance | MODERATE-HIGH | Related to kidney effects |
| Off-target vascular damage | UNCERTAIN | Theoretical concern |
| Long-term effects | UNKNOWN | No long-term data |

### Kidney Toxicity Warning

The Phase I human trial showed:
- Elevated creatinine (kidney stress marker)
- Proteinuria (protein in urine)
- Dehydration complications
- These effects were dose-limiting

### Why Safety Concerns Are Serious

1. **Vascular destruction is inherently risky** - Blood vessel damage can occur anywhere
2. **Kidney filtration** - Peptide cleared through kidneys may cause damage
3. **Dehydration cascade** - Fluid shifts with tissue death
4. **No targeted cancer parallel** - Unlike cancer drugs, risks not justified by terminal disease

### Contraindications

- Kidney disease (any degree)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Elderly
- Anyone not under intensive medical monitoring

## Anecdotal Reports (User Experiences)

**Note:** These are unverified reports from online forums and should not be considered medical evidence.

### Limited Reliable Data

Due to safety concerns and limited availability:
- Few reliable user reports exist
- Those who have tried report:
  - Rapid fat loss in some cases
  - Significant side effects common
  - Kidney concerns reported
  - Dehydration issues

### Reported Effects

- *"Lost fat quickly but felt terrible"*
- *"Had to stop due to kidney markers"*
- *"Very dehydrated despite drinking water"*
- *"Too risky - wouldn't recommend"*

## Comparison with Fat Loss Options

| Method | Efficacy | Safety | Permanence | Availability |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Diet/Exercise | Moderate | Safe | Reversible | Universal |
| GLP-1 agonists | High | Good | Reversible | Prescription |
| Liposuction | High | Moderate | Permanent | Surgical |
| **Adipotide** | Very High | **POOR** | Permanent | Research only |

---

## Why Development Likely Stopped

1. **Risk-benefit ratio unfavourable** - Fat loss doesn't justify kidney damage
2. **GLP-1 success** - Safer alternatives now available (semaglutide, tirzepatide)
3. **Regulatory concerns** - FDA unlikely to approve with current safety profile
4. **No path to market** - Cosmetic use wouldn't justify risks

---

## Practical Recommendations

### Strong Recommendation: AVOID

The case against Adipotide use is straightforward: kidney toxicity in humans for a cosmetic indication represents an unacceptable risk-benefit ratio. Unlike cancer chemotherapy where severe toxicity may be justified by terminal disease, fat loss does not warrant nephrotoxic risk.

The timing of Adipotide's failure is particularly relevant. Development halted just as GLP-1 receptor agonists were demonstrating remarkable efficacy for weight loss. Semaglutide and tirzepatide now achieve 15-20% body weight reduction with excellent safety profiles and regulatory approval. These alternatives eliminate any rational justification for Adipotide use.

Beyond safety concerns, sourcing presents insurmountable problems. No pharmaceutical company manufactures Adipotide. Any product claiming to be Adipotide would be from unregulated laboratories with no quality control, no sterility assurance, and no guarantee of identity. The compound's complexity makes underground synthesis particularly risky.

For individuals seeking significant fat loss, the evidence-based path is clear: medical supervision with approved GLP-1 agonists, combined with lifestyle modification. For those who have failed these approaches, working with an endocrinologist to identify metabolic barriers is far more rational than experimenting with a failed development compound carrying documented human toxicity.

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Efficacy evidence | Moderate (primate data strong) |
| Safety evidence | **POOR** (kidney toxicity in humans) |
| Quality assurance | **VERY POOR** (no legitimate source) |
| Alternatives available | YES (much safer options exist) |
| Risk-benefit | **UNFAVOURABLE** |
