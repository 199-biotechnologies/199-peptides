# AOD-9604 (HGH Fragment 177-191)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** OCEBM Level 4 (Phase II data)
**Risk Profile:** LOW
**WADA Status:** Prohibited (S2 – GH and related substances)

## What Is This?

AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone (specifically amino acids 177-191) that promotes fat burning without the muscle-building or blood sugar effects of full HGH. It was tested for obesity but didn't meet FDA approval standards — not due to safety concerns, but because the weight loss wasn't dramatic enough. It may be more useful for joint health than fat loss.

## Why AOD-9604 Is Unique

AOD-9604 represents an attempt to isolate the fat-burning properties of growth hormone while discarding the undesirable effects. Full HGH causes muscle growth, raises IGF-1 levels (associated with cancer risk), and disrupts glucose metabolism. AOD-9604 does none of these things.

The compound works through the beta-3 adrenergic pathway, triggering lipolysis (fat breakdown) without binding to growth hormone receptors. This mechanism explains why it promotes fat burning without the anabolic or metabolic effects of complete HGH.

| Parameter | Full HGH | AOD-9604 |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Fat loss | Yes | Yes |
| Muscle growth | Yes | **No** |
| IGF-1 increase | Yes | **None** |
| Glucose effects | Yes (negative) | **None** |
| Cancer risk concern | Yes | **Lower** |

The safety advantage is clear. The efficacy limitation is equally clear: by removing the anabolic effects, AOD-9604 also removes one of the primary reasons people use growth hormone.

## Clinical Evidence

### Phase II Trials: The Reality

Phase II trials demonstrated modest weight loss — approximately 2-3 kg more than placebo over 12 weeks. The compound was well-tolerated with no significant effects on IGF-1, glucose, or lipids. Statistically significant results were achieved on some endpoints.

But statistical significance and clinical significance are not the same thing. The weight loss was insufficient for FDA obesity drug approval. Development stopped not because of safety problems but because the drug simply wasn't effective enough to compete in the obesity market.

### The GLP-1 Context

To understand AOD-9604's commercial failure, consider the competition. Semaglutide produces 15% weight loss. Tirzepatide produces 20-22%. AOD-9604's 2-3 kg advantage over placebo couldn't compete.

### Joint/Cartilage Research: A Different Story

Interestingly, the joint health data is more promising than the fat loss data. Phase II trials for osteoarthritis showed positive results. Preclinical studies demonstrate cartilage repair effects. The compound may stimulate chondrocyte repair — potentially a better application than fat loss.

This pivot from metabolic to joint applications represents an important insight: AOD-9604's optimal use case may not be what it was originally developed for.

## Use Cases by Goal

### Body Composition Support (Not Primary Fat Loss)

AOD-9604 offers modest lipolytic effect without IGF-1 elevation. This makes it suitable for those near their goal weight seeking minor refinement, not those needing significant weight loss.

**Protocol:** 250-300mcg SC daily
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks
**Timing:** Morning fasted; 30+ min before food
**Who Benefits:** Near goal weight, seeking minor body composition refinement

**Reality Check:** Effects are subtle compared to GLP-1 drugs.

### IGF-1 Avoidance (Safety-Focused)

For those wanting GH-derived fat-burning effects without IGF-1 elevation and associated cancer concerns, AOD-9604 offers a cleaner option.

**Protocol:** 250-300mcg daily
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Who Benefits:** Cancer survivors, those with elevated IGF-1 concerns

### Joint Health / Osteoarthritis

This may be AOD-9604's best application. The chondrocyte-stimulating effects and positive Phase II osteoarthritis data suggest genuine utility for joint support.

**Protocol:** 250-300mcg daily
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks
**Who Benefits:** Joint pain, osteoarthritis

### GLP-1 Alternative (GI Intolerant)

For those who cannot tolerate the nausea and gastrointestinal effects of semaglutide or tirzepatide, AOD-9604 offers a much gentler alternative — albeit with much reduced efficacy.

**Protocol:** 250-300mcg daily + diet/exercise
**Duration:** 12+ weeks

## Anecdotal Reports (User Experiences)

**Note:** These are unverified reports from online forums and should not be considered medical evidence.

| Use Case | User Reports |
|----------|--------------|
| Fat loss | *"Subtle but noticeable fat loss over 8 weeks"*, *"Stomach fat specifically reduced"*, *"Good addition to diet and exercise"* |
| Joint health | *"Better than expected for joint pain"*, *"Knees feel better"* |
| Safety | *"No side effects at all—very clean"* |
| Reality check | *"Not dramatic like GLP-1 drugs"*, *"Hard to tell if working"*, *"Tolerable alternative, just not as effective"* |

## Timing and Administration

### Optimal Timing

| Goal | Timing |
|------|--------|
| Fat loss | Morning, fasted |
| Fasted cardio | 30-60 min before |
| Joint health | Any time |

### Dosing

**Empirical clinic protocols (not trial-validated):**

| Protocol | Dose | Frequency |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Starting | 150mcg | Daily |
| Standard | 250-300mcg | Daily |
| Higher | 500mcg | Daily |

### Cycling

A 5-on/2-off pattern is common, typically in 8-12 week blocks. Long-term continuous use hasn't been studied.

## User Experience Timeline

| Week | Observation |
|------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Little noticeable |
| 2-4 | Possible subtle changes |
| 4-8 | Mild fat loss if present |
| 8-12 | Body composition changes |

---

## Side Effects

| Category | Effects |
|----------|---------|
| Common | Injection-site irritation, mild headache, mild GI |
| Serious | None clearly drug-related in trials; long-term data lacking |

The key safety point is the lack of effect on IGF-1 and glucose — this is AOD-9604's main advantage over full HGH.

## Realistic Expectations

Set expectations appropriately. AOD-9604 provides modest fat loss support, not dramatic weight loss. It works best combined with diet and exercise, and may be more useful for body composition changes than scale weight. The joint benefits may actually be more significant than the fat loss benefits.

**Who Benefits Most:**
- Those avoiding IGF-1 elevation
- Already near goal weight
- Joint pain issues
- GLP-1 intolerant

**Who Should Look Elsewhere:**
- Significant weight loss needed → GLP-1 agonists
- Expecting dramatic results

---

## Monitoring

| Test | Baseline | Ongoing | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Weight | Yes | Monthly | Efficacy tracking |
| Body composition | Yes | Every 2-3 months | Better indicator than scale weight |
| Lipid panel | Yes | Every 6 months | Metabolic health |
| ApoB | Yes | Every 6-12 months | Superior CV risk marker |
| Lp(a) | Baseline only | - | Genetic risk marker |
| Fasting glucose | Yes | Every 6 months | Confirm no glucose effect |
| IGF-1 | Optional baseline | - | Confirm no elevation (AOD-9604 should NOT raise IGF-1) |

**Note:** AOD-9604 specifically does NOT elevate IGF-1, which is its main safety advantage over full HGH. If IGF-1 rises, the product may be contaminated or mislabelled.

## Contraindications

- Allergy to peptide components
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding (no data)
- Active cancer (theoretical)

---

## Limitations

1. **Modest efficacy** — Failed FDA obesity approval
2. **Subtle effects** — Many users report "didn't notice much"
3. **Better alternatives exist** for weight loss (GLP-1s)
4. **Cost** relative to benefit
