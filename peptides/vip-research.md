# VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)

**Research Compilation Date:** December 4, 2025
**Evidence Level:** Extensive Preclinical + Clinical Research
**Risk Profile:** LOW-MODERATE

---

## What Is This?

VIP is a natural neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory (blood vessel relaxing) effects. It's best known as the **final step in the Shoemaker mold illness (CIRS) protocol** — only used after 8 other steps are completed. VIP calms overactive immune responses and opens blood vessels. The challenge: it's rapidly destroyed in the body (half-life 1-2 minutes), requiring frequent nasal dosing (typically 50mcg 4x daily). Also being developed as Aviptadil for pulmonary conditions. Can cause flushing and low blood pressure — use cautiously if you already have hypotension.

## Overview

Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is a 28 amino acid neuropeptide with widespread distribution throughout the body, particularly in the nervous and immune systems. It has potent vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. VIP has been researched for conditions including CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), pulmonary hypertension, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker has notably promoted VIP for mold illness treatment.

## Mechanism of Action

VIP operates across five interconnected physiological systems, creating a multi-modal therapeutic profile. Vasodilation sits at the core — VIP potently relaxes blood vessels throughout the body, reducing blood pressure and improving blood flow. Pulmonary vascular effects are particularly pronounced, driving the drug development path toward ARDS and pulmonary hypertension. This isn't subtle vessel relaxation; it's powerful enough to cause clinical hypotension if not managed carefully.

The anti-inflammatory effects work through cytokine modulation. VIP inhibits the pro-inflammatory triad of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 while promoting IL-10, the body's primary anti-inflammatory cytokine. Macrophage function shifts from inflammatory to regulatory phenotypes. At the immune system level, VIP promotes Th2 and regulatory T-cell responses while suppressing Th1 and Th17-driven inflammation. It induces tolerogenic dendritic cells — antigen-presenting cells that promote immune tolerance rather than activation. This immunomodulatory profile makes VIP compelling for autoimmune conditions, though clinical validation remains limited.

Neuroprotection represents a distinct mechanism: VIP supports neuronal survival, reduces excitotoxicity, and enhances neurotrophic factor production. It participates in circadian rhythm regulation, connecting to the sleep and energy disturbances common in CIRS patients. In the gut, VIP regulates intestinal motility and secretion while maintaining barrier integrity and providing local anti-inflammatory effects. This GI involvement explains both the therapeutic rationale and the diarrhoea side effect — VIP's effects on gut function cut both ways.

## Clinical Applications

### CIRS/Mold Illness (Shoemaker Protocol)

VIP sits at the final step of the Shoemaker CIRS protocol — deliberately positioned after eight prerequisite interventions are completed. The rationale centres on restoring VIP-mediated regulation of immune and vascular function that Shoemaker believes is disrupted in mold illness. Delivery is intranasal, typically 50mcg four times daily. The critical context: this application rests entirely on Shoemaker's clinical experience and observational data. No randomised controlled trials validate VIP for CIRS or mold illness. It's a protocol built from clinical pattern recognition rather than formal evidence generation.

### Pulmonary Hypertension

The pulmonary vasodilation mechanism makes VIP a logical candidate for pulmonary hypertension. Small clinical trials have shown positive signals, and the synthetic analog aviptadil entered formal development for pulmonary and ARDS indications. This represents the pharmaceutical validation path — taking VIP's biological activity and developing a more stable, proprietary version for FDA approval. Evidence level sits above CIRS (actual clinical trials exist) but below established therapy (trials remain small and early-phase).

### Other Research Areas

Autoimmune diseases show strong preclinical evidence driven by VIP's immunomodulatory effects, but human validation is absent. Neurodegenerative conditions remain in preclinical territory, with mechanism-based rationale but no clinical data. Sepsis studies are similarly early-stage. ARDS and COVID-19 received attention during the pandemic, with aviptadil entering clinical trials for severe respiratory inflammation. These trials represent the strongest formal evidence path beyond the CIRS observational experience.

Hospital and trial settings use IV aviptadil at tens of micrograms per dose under intensive monitoring — protocols entirely unsuitable for outpatient self-administration. The distinction matters: clinical trials employ controlled environments with continuous monitoring, fundamentally different from home-based nasal spray protocols.

## Administration

### Intranasal (Most Common for CIRS)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Shoemaker dose | 50mcg 4x daily |
| Delivery | Nasal spray |
| Duration | Variable (weeks to months) |
| Absorption | Rapid but variable |

### Challenge: Short Half-Life

VIP is rapidly degraded:
