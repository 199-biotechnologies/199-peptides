# TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4 Fragment)

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**OCEBM Evidence Level:** 4-5 (Phase I human data + extensive preclinical)
**Risk Profile:** MODERATE (Documented oncogenic pathway involvement)

---

## What Is This?

TB-500 is a synthetic fragment of Thymosin Beta-4, used for injury recovery — particularly tendons, ligaments, and muscle tears. Unlike BPC-157 (which works locally), TB-500 works systemically by mobilizing stem cells from bone marrow, so injection site doesn't matter. **Critical concern:** TB-500 is overexpressed in multiple cancers and enhances metastasis in lab studies. One mouse study showed 4.3x more metastatic lung nodules with TB-4 exposure. This isn't theoretical — it's documented oncogenic pathway activation. **Avoid if any personal or family history of solid tumors.** For healthy individuals with serious injuries, it may accelerate healing, but the cancer risk profile warrants caution.

## Clinical Evidence

### The Human Data Picture

TB-500 occupies an unusual position in the peptide landscape: its parent compound, Thymosin Beta-4, has been through formal Phase I safety trials, while TB-500 itself has not. This creates an evidence gap that users must navigate carefully.

The Phase I studies of injectable recombinant human thymosin demonstrated no toxicities or serious adverse events across multiple doses. Subsequent trials using full synthetic TB4 administered cumulative doses of 42–1260 mg over 14 days — vastly exceeding what TB-500 users typically employ — again without significant adverse events. A topical formulation (0.03% thymosin-beta-4 gel) showed favorable results in venous ulcer healing.

The most intriguing human application came from Zhu et al. in 2016, who pre-treated endothelial progenitor cells with TB4 before transplanting them into patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Both safety and efficacy signals emerged, suggesting TB4's regenerative properties extend to cardiac tissue.

### The Preclinical Promise

In animal models, TB-500's effects on tissue repair are substantial. Wound healing studies show 42-61% improvement in re-epithelialization rates. Tendon repair models demonstrate improved collagen organization. Cardiac injury models show reduced infarct size and improved function. Corneal damage heals faster. Even hair follicle stem cells activate — an incidental finding that some users now pursue intentionally.

### Interpreting the Evidence

The gap between TB4 safety data and TB-500 use remains significant. While the parent compound's safety profile is reassuring, TB-500 is a fragment that may behave differently. The 2024 discovery that the metabolite Ac-LKKTE may actually be the primary active compound further complicates interpretation — TB-500 might simply be a prodrug, converted to something else in the body.

## Mechanism of Action

TB-500's mechanism differs fundamentally from most other healing peptides. Rather than working locally at the injury site, it operates systemically through actin regulation and stem cell mobilisation.

Actin is the protein that forms the cellular skeleton, and TB-500 sequesters actin monomers, regulating how cells move, migrate, and restructure during repair. When tissue is damaged, cells need to migrate to the wound site, and TB-500 facilitates this process by modulating the actin cytoskeleton.

The stem cell mobilisation pathway may be even more significant. TB-500 appears to signal bone marrow to release progenitor cells into circulation, where they can home to damaged tissues. This explains why injection site is irrelevant — the compound works by recruiting the body's repair cells from their central reservoir, not by acting locally.

These mechanisms come with consequences. The same actin regulation and cell migration that facilitate healing also facilitate metastasis. The same angiogenesis that supplies healing tissue also supplies tumours.

## Oncogenesis Risk Assessment

### The Cancer Connection Is Not Theoretical

Unlike the speculative oncogenic concerns with some peptides, TB-500's cancer connection is documented in laboratory studies. Thymosin Beta-4 is overexpressed in multiple human cancers: colon adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

### The Metastasis Data

The most concerning study comes from Xie et al., published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2003. Mice injected with TB4-expressing cells developed a mean of 46.7 metastatic lung nodules compared to 10.9 in controls — a 4.3-fold increase. The mechanism was clear: 2.3-fold increase in cell migration, 4.4-fold increase in tumour blood vessels, and direct induction of VEGF expression.

Studies in non-small cell lung cancer showed that silencing TB4 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while decreasing tumour growth in vivo through the Notch1 activation pathway. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TMSB4X overexpression correlated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival.

### The Exception: Multiple Myeloma

Intriguingly, TB4 shows tumour suppressor activity in multiple myeloma — lower expression than normal plasma cells, with overexpression actually decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis sensitivity. This tissue-specific difference highlights how cancer biology rarely follows simple rules.

### Risk Assessment

This is not a compound for anyone with solid tumour history. The evidence of metastasis enhancement, angiogenesis promotion, and MMP upregulation (enabling tumour invasion) creates a risk profile that demands respect.

**Avoid in:**
- Personal history of solid tumours
- Family history of colon, lung, kidney, or liver cancer
- Active malignancy (absolute contraindication)
- High-risk surveillance populations

### Monitoring Protocol (If Using)

| Test | Baseline | Ongoing | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| CBC with differential | Yes | Every 3 months | Blood cancer screening |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel | Yes | Every 3 months | Liver/kidney function |
| PSA (men >40) | Yes | Every 6 months | Prostate surveillance |
| CEA | Yes | Every 6 months | Colorectal marker |
| CA-125 (women) | Yes | Every 6 months | Ovarian surveillance |
| CT chest (if lung ca risk) | Consider | Annual | Lung metastasis surveillance |
| Skin exam | Yes | Monthly self-exam | Melanoma screening |

### Cessation Rules

**Any elevation in PSA, CEA, or CA-125:** Immediate cessation of ALL growth factors (GH peptides, BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, Dihexa)

**Immediately discontinue** if new unexplained mass, persistent lymphadenopathy, or any rising tumour marker is detected.

**Avoid any use** in individuals with prior solid tumour unless oncology explicitly agrees.

## 2024 Mechanistic Discovery

Recent research has revealed that the metabolite Ac-LKKTE may be the primary active compound rather than TB-500 itself. This metabolite shows more potent effects than TB-500 in some assays, while full TB4 demonstrates more robust responses than the fragment. The implications are significant: TB-500 may be suboptimal compared to full TB4, which is harder to source and more expensive, or the peptide may simply serve as a delivery vehicle for its metabolite.

## Use Cases by Goal

### Serious Injury Recovery (Tendon, Ligament, Muscle Tears)

TB-500's systemic mechanism makes it particularly suited for injuries where local approaches have limited reach. Stem cell mobilisation and actin regulation operate throughout the body, potentially addressing multiple damage sites simultaneously or reaching areas difficult to target with local injections.

**Protocol:** 2.5mg 2x weekly (loading), then 2.5mg weekly (maintenance)
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks loading, then maintenance until healed
**Timing:** Systemic—injection site doesn't matter

### Post-Surgical Recovery

The same mechanisms that accelerate injury healing apply to surgical wounds. Increased cell migration and blood vessel formation support tissue reconstruction.

**Protocol:** 2.5mg 2x weekly starting post-op
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Timing:** Begin when cleared by surgeon

### Chronic Tendinopathy / Joint Support

For chronic conditions where tissue quality has deteriorated over time, TB-500's collagen organisation effects may address the underlying structural problem rather than just symptoms.

**Protocol:** 2.5mg weekly ongoing or cycled
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks

### Hair Regrowth (Incidental Finding)

The activation of hair follicle stem cells was an unexpected discovery that some users now pursue intentionally. The mechanism is consistent with TB-500's broader stem cell effects.

**Protocol:** 2.5mg weekly
**Duration:** 3-6 months minimum

### Combined with BPC-157 (Belt and Suspenders)

The combination addresses injury through complementary mechanisms: BPC-157 operates locally through the NO system while TB-500 works systemically through actin regulation and stem cell mobilisation. For serious injuries, this "belt and suspenders" approach may offer advantages over either compound alone, though no controlled studies have tested the combination.

**Protocol:** BPC-157 250mcg 2x daily at injury site + TB-500 2.5mg 2x weekly
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks

## Timing and Administration

### Injection Protocols

| Application | Route | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Any injury | SC or IM | Site doesn't matter—systemic action |
| Convenience | Abdomen SC | Most common |
| High volume | Intramuscular | Larger doses |

### Why Local Injection Doesn't Matter

TB-500 works via stem cell mobilisation from bone marrow and systemic actin regulation. The compound distributes throughout the body regardless of injection site, making abdominal subcutaneous injection as effective as injecting near the injury — a key difference from BPC-157, which benefits from local administration.

## TB-500 vs Full Thymosin Beta-4

| Factor | TB-500 | Full TB4 |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Size | 7 AA | 43 AA |
| Efficacy | Good | Potentially better |
| Stability | More stable | Less stable |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Availability | Easy | Difficult |
| Evidence | Substantial | More extensive |

## Reported Side Effects

Phase I trials with the parent compound showed excellent tolerability. Commonly reported effects from TB-500 use include:
- Hair growth (common incidental finding)
- Mild injection site reactions
- No significant adverse events in controlled studies

---

## Synergies

### With BPC-157

The combination makes mechanistic sense: TB-500's actin regulation and systemic stem cell effects complement BPC-157's NO system modulation and local growth factor signalling. Users report enhanced healing with the combination, though no controlled studies exist.

### With GHK-Cu

Both compounds promote tissue repair through different pathways. GHK-Cu's collagen synthesis effects complement TB-500's cellular migration and stem cell mobilisation.
