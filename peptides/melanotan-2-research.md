## What Is This?

Melanotan 2 is a synthetic hormone that causes tanning without sun exposure and increases libido. It's extremely popular but **carries serious risks**: multiple melanoma cases have been documented in users, it darkens existing moles (making cancer surveillance impossible), and development was halted by regulators due to safety concerns. It's banned in the UK and not approved anywhere. For the sexual effects alone, PT-141 (FDA-approved as Vyleesi) is the safer, evidence-based choice.

## Mechanism of Action

Melanotan-2 activates multiple melanocortin receptors throughout the body, creating effects that range from desired to dangerous. The MC1R activation drives melanin production in skin melanocytes—the tanning effect that makes the compound popular. This works even without UV exposure, though sunlight dramatically accelerates the response. The same melanocyte stimulation that creates an artificial tan also stimulates existing moles, freckles, and potentially precancerous lesions.

The sexual effects come from MC3R and MC4R activation in hypothalamic regions controlling appetite and sexual arousal. These central nervous system effects increase libido, trigger spontaneous erections in men, and enhance sexual desire in both sexes. The appetite suppression some users report follows the same pathway—MC4R plays a key role in satiety signalling.

What makes this mechanism concerning is the non-selective nature of melanocortin activation. The compound doesn't distinguish between normal melanocytes, atypical moles, or melanoma cells. Every melanocyte in the body receives the same growth and pigmentation signal, regardless of whether that stimulation is safe.

## Clinical Evidence

The clinical evidence for Melanotan-2 tells two stories: one of efficacy, one of serious safety signals that halted development.

Early phase trials confirmed the tanning effects—melanin production increases significantly within 1-2 weeks of use, reaching full effect over 4-6 weeks. The effect works with minimal sun exposure and persists for months after discontinuation as melanin naturally turns over. Sexual effects were noted as side effects in tanning studies before becoming the primary research focus: both men and women reported increased libido and spontaneous arousal at doses used for tanning.

Then came the case reports. A 20-year-old woman with Fitzpatrick type II skin using MT-2 alongside tanning beds developed cutaneous melanoma. A 23-year-old man noticed a pigmented leg lesion growing after MT-1 use—biopsy revealed melanoma with 1mm Breslow depth. A 42-year-old woman saw transformation of an existing abdominal mole three months after starting injections; histopathology confirmed 0.3mm melanoma. Most recently, a 2025 case report documented a 22-year-old woman using MT-2 nasal spray who developed mucosal malignant melanoma of the anterior maxilla—a rare and aggressive cancer with poor prognosis.

One particularly alarming case involved a 25-year-old man who developed sudden eruption of more than 100 melanocytic nevi after just four weeks of MT-2 use. Ten of the most atypical were excised and examined: all showed dysplasia, three with severe dysplasia representing precancerous changes. This wasn't dormant pathology uncovered by examination—this was new mole formation with immediate atypical features.

The pattern across reported cases shows multiple risk factors clustering: fair skin (Fitzpatrick I/II), multiple pre-existing moles, personal or family melanoma history, and concurrent UV exposure from tanning beds or sun. This doesn't prove causation—people using tanning peptides tend to tan heavily—but the consistency of the signal led Australian regulators (TGA) to halt development, led the UK to ban sales (MHRA), and led the original pharmaceutical developer Clinuvel to abandon the compound entirely.

## Risk Assessment

Melanotan-2 carries a high-risk profile that must be weighed against the modest benefits of artificial tanning. The documented melanoma cases represent either causation or correlation—we don't have controlled trials to establish which—but multiple mechanisms make causation plausible. Melanocortin receptors drive melanocyte proliferation and pigment production; stimulating them in dysplastic moles or nascent melanomas could accelerate transformation or growth. The case of 100+ new moles with immediate dysplasia demonstrates that MT-2 can trigger melanocyte proliferation and dysplastic changes in real time, not just theoretically.

The diagnostic masking problem compounds the direct risk. MT-2 darkens all pigmented lesions—normal moles, atypical moles, and early melanomas alike. During use, you cannot monitor moles for the ABCDE criteria dermatologists use to detect melanoma: asymmetry, border irregularity, colour variation, diameter changes, and evolution over time. When everything darkens together, early cancer detection becomes impossible. By the time darkening fades months after discontinuation, a melanoma may have progressed beyond early-stage detection.

The absolute contraindications aren't arbitrary caution—they represent populations where baseline risk makes additional melanocyte stimulation unconscionable: anyone with personal or family melanoma history, anyone with multiple atypical moles or dysplastic nevus syndrome, anyone with Fitzpatrick type I skin that burns rather than tans, anyone with active skin cancer. In these groups, even the theoretical risk exceeds any benefit.

For others, the risk calculation is less clear but still serious. Young users with few moles and no risk factors face lower absolute risk but still face unknown risk elevation and decades of potential melanoma surveillance. Every dose stimulates every melanocyte, every injection makes future mole changes harder to interpret, and every month of use extends the period when cancer detection is compromised.

The regulatory response tells its own story. When the original pharmaceutical company abandoned development, when Australia's TGA halted clinical work, when the UK banned sales outright, they weren't reacting to hypothetical risks. They were responding to case reports, mechanistic concerns, and the reality that no clinical trial could ethically recruit participants to establish melanoma risk with adequate power and follow-up time. The compound remains available only through grey-market channels with no quality assurance, no pharmaceutical oversight, and no post-market surveillance for adverse events.

## Dosing

### Loading Phase

| Day | Dose |
|-----|------|
| 1-3 | 0.25mg (tolerance assessment) |
| 4-7 | 0.5mg |
| Week 2+ | 0.5-1mg until desired tan |

### Maintenance

| Protocol | Dose | Frequency |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Minimal | 0.25-0.5mg | 1-2x weekly |
| Standard | 0.5mg | 2-3x weekly |
| Sexual use | 0.5-1mg | As needed |

**Route:** Subcutaneous; nasal spray available (variable absorption)

### Nasal Spray Warning

**2025 Case Report:** A 22-year-old female using MT-II nasal spray developed **mucosal malignant melanoma** of the anterior maxilla. This is the first documented case linking MT-II nasal spray specifically to oral/nasal mucosal melanoma.

**Concerns with nasal administration:**
- Direct exposure of nasal/oral mucosa to melanogenic stimulation
- Mucosal melanoma is rare but aggressive with poor prognosis
- Variable and unpredictable absorption
- No dosing standardization

**Recommendation:** If using MT-II despite risks, subcutaneous injection is preferable to nasal spray to avoid direct mucosal melanocyte stimulation.

## Synergies and Stacking

Melanotan-2 is not a compound to stack casually—the risks already present at therapeutic doses mean adding other interventions requires careful consideration of both benefits and compounded risks. The tanning effect doesn't synergise with anything beyond UV exposure, which accelerates pigmentation but also increases melanoma risk independently. Using MT-2 specifically to minimise sun exposure makes mechanistic sense—achieve colour without UV damage—but users often do the opposite, combining both stimuli.

For sexual effects, MT-2 stacks mechanistically with PDE5 inhibitors through different pathways: MT-2 drives central desire through melanocortin receptors while sildenafil or tadalafil enable vascular function. However, PT-141 (bremelanotide) offers the same central mechanism without tanning or melanoma concerns, making MT-2/PDE5 combinations obsolete for sexual function purposes. If sexual effects alone are desired, PT-141 is the evidence-based choice.

The compound doesn't interact significantly with testosterone optimization, growth hormone protocols, or most other peptide interventions. The primary consideration with any combination is whether the added intervention increases melanoma risk (UV exposure, immunosuppressants) or makes surveillance more difficult (anything else causing skin changes).

What should never be combined: MT-2 with PT-141, as they share melanocortin pathways and offer no additive benefit; MT-2 with intensive UV exposure in fair-skinned individuals; MT-2 with any intervention that impairs immune surveillance of nascent cancers.

## Use Cases

Melanotan-2 has two primary use cases, one aesthetic and one functional, neither of which justify the risk profile in most individuals.

The tanning application—achieving pigmentation without sun exposure—has superficial appeal for people with pale skin who burn easily, for those seeking year-round colour, or for bodybuilders wanting enhanced muscle definition through skin contrast. The compound works: it produces genuine melanin, not a spray-tan aesthetic, and the effect lasts months. But this is fundamentally cosmetic benefit weighed against melanoma risk, mole masking, and regulatory abandonment by pharmaceutical developers. No responsible risk assessment supports using MT-2 for tanning when the original developer halted development specifically due to safety concerns raised by regulators.

The sexual function application has more medical legitimacy—low libido causes genuine distress—but is now obsolete. PT-141 (bremelanotide) offers the same melanocortin-mediated desire enhancement without MC1R activation, without tanning, without mole stimulation, without melanoma signal. PT-141 is FDA-approved, studied in Phase III trials, and lacks the safety signals that halted MT-2 development. Using MT-2 for sexual effects when PT-141 exists makes no sense unless you specifically want tanning—at which point you're accepting melanoma risk for cosmetic benefit while treating a medical condition.

There are no use cases where MT-2 represents best practice. For tanning, acceptance of natural skin tone or careful UV exposure with sun protection are safer. For sexual function, PT-141 is safer and evidence-based. For both simultaneously, the risks of MT-2 exceed the benefit of convenience.

The only population where MT-2 use might be rational is those with extensive prior use, no adverse effects, comprehensive dermatology surveillance, and informed acceptance of ongoing risk. Even then, transitioning to PT-141 for sexual effects and discontinuing tanning would reduce risk substantially.
